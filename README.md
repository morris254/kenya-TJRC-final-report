# An Accessible version of the TJRC Final Report


## Overview

This repo contains an accessible version of the Final Report of The Truth
Justice and Reconciliation Commission of Kenya. The original report was
[published on their
website](http://www.tjrckenya.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=573&Itemid=238)
as several very large PDFs.


## Initial Aim

- Create a version of the report that is accessible over the web on low end mobile devices - such as are common in Kenya.
- Make it possible to link to specific parts of the report and make those links stable.


## Original PDFs

The original PDFs that this content is extracted from are available from http://www.tjrckenya.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=573&Itemid=238 and are not stored in this repository.

You can run the following command to retrieve them:

```bash
make get-originals
```
