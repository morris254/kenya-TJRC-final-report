Foreword

It has been a long journey. From the day of our swearing in on 3 August 2009, to the
handing of this Report to the President, we have experienced every emotion; from joy, to
frustration, to exhilaration, to humility.

This Commission collected the largest number of statements of any truth commission
in history. With the tireless help of the over 300 statement takers we hired, and the more
than a hundred that were seconded to us by civil society organizations, we collected over
40,000 statements. It is difficult to discern the significance of this singular achievement.
While the statement taking form was pronounced by international experts in the field
as one of the best they had ever seen, we acknowledge that there is a wide variety of
detail and accuracy in the statements we collected. We also acknowledge that, as far as
we are aware, we deployed by far the largest number of statement takers of any other
truth commission, thus perhaps contributing to the large numbers of statements we
collected.

What we can say with confidence, however, is that the record number of statements
collected affirms our individual perceptions as we travelled the length and breadth of
the country: there is a hunger, a desire, even a demand for the injustices of the past to
be addressed so that those individuals who have borne the brunt of those injustices,
and the nation as a whole, may move on. The 2003 Task Force on the Establishment
of a Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission reported that over 90 percent of
Kenyans wanted a truth justice and reconciliation commission. We are not in a position
to confirm that percentage, but we can with full confidence, on the basis on our
collective experience, report that the vast majority of Kenyans not only wanted such
a commission, but were willing to spend a significant amount of their own time, and
sometimes money and other resources, to participate in a truth-telling process.

This is a Report. It is written with words, and printed on paper or converted into
electronic bits and bytes. Yet it is the product of, in some cases literally, the blood,
sweat and tears of the stories that were told to us as we travelled the country. The
written word, no matter how poetic, cannot convey accurately the passion with which
people demanded to tell their stories and the integrity and dignity with which they
related their experiences. It cannot convey the silence, the tears, and the emotions that
engulfed the venue at which a man described how he lost his entire family during the
2007/2008 Post Election Violence (PEV). It cannot convey the traumatic experience of a
woman who was raped during the PEV and her fear that the same could happen to her

           during the 2013 elections. Nor can it convey the horrid experience of a woman who had
           to carry the head of her slain husband all the way from Nakuru to Kisumu. It can neither
           convey the tears that were shed before this Commission nor the tears that were shed
           by the Commission’s staff and Commissioners. The stories in these pages are horrid but
           they did happen, here on our land. In a nutshell, there has been, there is, suffering in
           the land.

           So while this Report is the final product of this Commission, and with the passage
           of time will be viewed as the primary legacy of our work, we know that the work of
           the Commission is also written in the hearts and souls of each and every person who
           interacted with the Commission: the statement takers and statement givers; victims,
           adversely mentioned persons, and those who reside simultaneously in both categories;
           witnesses who testified in public, and those who testified in camera; those employed
           by the Commission, and those who took on the task of monitoring and reporting on
           the work of the Commission; and finally, the millions of others who may have viewed
           a news story, or read an opinion piece, or seen the Commission’s truck with our logo,
           Tusirudie Tena! blazoned on its side. Each of these individuals, and the interactions they
           had with the Commission, whether positive or negative, are a part of this Report, and
           thus a part of the legacy of our work.

           This has been a Commission that, like many that went before it, both in Kenya and abroad,
           has faced its challenges. Some of those challenges at times threatened the very existence
           of the organization, and took its toll on many of us, both physically and emotionally. We
           lost our original Vice Chair, Betty Kaari Murungi, because of some of those challenges. She
           was never replaced, and we end this process with only eight, rather than the original nine,
           Commissioners.

           We faced the many challenges, both anticipated and unanticipated, with courage,
           conviction, and commitment. How well we succeeded in the end is not for us to say.
           Instead it is for the people of Kenya, both today and in the future, to determine how much
           what we have provided in these pages – and perhaps more importantly, how much our
           work throughout the four corners of the country over the last four years – contributes to
           truth, justice, national unity and reconciliation.

           We know that some have been frustrated by the fact that we spent four years on a
           task for which we were originally given a maximum of two and a half years. At times it
           frustrated us. In the best of circumstances, compiling a complete and accurate history
           of historical injustices and gross violations of human rights (including violations of not
           just the traditional bodily integrity rights, but all of the aforementioned plus socio-
           economic rights, corruption, land, and economic marginalization) over a forty-five
           year period would be a daunting task to complete in four years, much less two and

a half years. In fact it was clear to us from the early days of the Commission that ours
was not to provide the definitive history of the broad range of violations committed
and suffered during that forty-five year period. Rather, we took our task to be making
a significant contribution to our collective understanding of that past, particularly
through the experiences and voices of those who experienced it first-hand. It is our
hope that this Report, and the other work of the Commission, has at least done that.

After four years, we are truly humbled by the enormity of the task facing this great
country of ours. While we have made a small, yet we hope significant, contribution to
addressing the legacy of gross violations of human rights and historical injustices, there
is much still to be done. Yet, we take faith in the reforms that have already occurred,
including the adoption of the 2010 Constitution, and those currently in process. Even
more importantly, we are humbled by and also draw strength from the millions of
Kenyans who, in the face of sometimes insurmountable odds, struggle to provide for
themselves, their families, their communities, and the nation at large. It is that spirit of
perseverance in the face of adversity, the willingness and ability to rise up above such
challenges with dignity and integrity, which we saw in Kenyans throughout this great
land that gives us hope for the future of this beautiful country.

God bless Kenya.

   Factors that encouraged perpetuation of gross violations of human rights

   	The failure of the first government in independent Kenya (led by President Jomo Kenyatta) to dismantle the repressive state
     structures established by the colonial government
   	The use of and subsequent enhancement of repressive laws, policies and practices initially employed by the colonial
     government by post-independence political administrations (President Jomo Kenyatta’s and President Daniel Arap Moi’s
     administrations)
   	The creation of a de jure one party state by President Moi’s administration, resulting in severe repression of political dissent
     and intimidation and control of the media. Repression of political speech and the media allowed many violations to occur
     with little public scrutiny, much less accountability.
   	Consolidation of immense powers in the person of the President, coupled with the deliberate erosion of the independence
     of both the Judiciary and the Legislature.
   	The failure of the state to investigate and punish gross violations of human rights. The Commission finds that in most cases,
     the state has covered-up or down-played violations committed especially by state security agencies. During the entire
     mandate period (1963-2008), the state demonstrated no genuine commitment to investigate and punish atrocities and

                                                                                   ONE
      Background to the Commission


Introduction
1.	      The horrific violence that followed the disputed 2007 Presidential Election results
         deeply shocked Kenyans. It forced the tragic realisation that long-standing
         resentments and historical grievances had left communities so deeply divided that
         it threatened the stability of the nation and the ability to move forward together.

2.	      Long considered an island of peace and stability, Kenya tottered on the brink of
         collapse, begging for answers. Why at all did it become necessary that as a nation
         Kenya should confront its past through the establishment of a truth commission
         and other mechanisms? The short answer to this question lies in the preamble
         to the Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Act,1 the legislation which established
         the Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission (TJRC’). The preamble reads as
         follows:

             Desirous that our nation achieves its full potential in social, economic and political
             development; Concerned that since independence there has occurred in Kenya gross
             violation of human rights, abuse of power and misuse of public office;
             Concerned that some transgressions against our country and its people cannot be
             properly addressed by our judicial institutions due to procedural and other hindrances
             and conscious, however, that we must as a nation address the past in order to prepare
             for the future by building a democratic society based on the rule of law;

                             Aware that the process of achieving lasting peace and harmonious co-existence among
                             Kenyans would be best served by enabling Kenyans to discard such matters in a free and
                             reconciliatory forum;

                             Deeply concerned that the culmination of the polarisation of our country and the feeling
                             of resentment among Kenyans was the tragic post-election violence that followed the
                             announcement of the 2007 Presidential election results;

                             Desirous to give the people of Kenya a fresh start where justice is accorded to the victims
                             of injustice and past transgressions are adequately addressed:

                             Now, therefore, be it enacted by the Parliament of Kenya [the Truth, Justice and
                             Reconciliation Act].

                  3.	     This Chapter is structurally divided into two broad parts. The first part traces
                          the historical background leading to the establishment of the Commission. The
                          second part describes the actual establishment of the Commission. This includes
                          a description of the following: the selection and appointment of Commissioners;
                          and the management and administration of the Commission.

Historical Context
Independence, high expectations and hopes

4.	   Few events in Kenya’s history are as memorable as the Independence Day
      celebrations across the country on 12 December 1963 when British colonial rule
      came to an end. The joy, pride, excitement and euphoria witnessed that Thursday
      morning was unprecedented. Independence was made possible by the gallant
      Kenyan men and women who risked and sacrificed their lives and limbs fighting
      for freedom from colonial rule. With relentless courage they fought and died, not
      only for their own freedom, but also for the freedom of their children and their
      children’s children – the generations not yet born.

5.	   Independence came not only at a great price but also with high expectations and
      hopes. Independence signified an end to practices that had been institutionalised
      under British rule; the end of racial segregation, detention camps, torture,
      massacres, unlawful killings and similar practices that had been institutionalised
      under colonialism.

6.	   To the citizens of a new free nation, independence meant the return to lands from
      which they had been forcibly evicted and of which they had been dispossessed in
      order to pave way for British settlers. It was supposed to be the beginning of political
      and economic emancipation; the start of respect for the rule of law, human rights
      and dignity and the laying down of the foundations and tenets of democracy.
      Many envisioned a united nation. The high expectations and hopes of Kenyans at
      independence were succinctly summarised in the national anthem:

         Oh God of all creation
         Bless this our land and nation
         Justice be our shield and defender
         May we dwell in unity
         Peace and liberty
         Plenty be found within our borders

         Let one and all arise
         With hearts both strong and true
         Service be our earnest endeavour
         And our homeland of Kenya
         Heritage of splendour
         Firm may we stand to defend

Volume I   Chapter ONE




                         Let all with one accord
                         In common bond united
                         Build this our nation together
                         And the glory of Kenya
                         The fruit of our labour
                         Fill every heart with thanksgiving

             7.	     What followed this moment of renewal and optimism was a history of political
                     repression, blatant injustices and widespread, systematic violation of human rights.


             Lost dreams
             8.	     The first political administration in independent Kenya – under the leadership of
                     President Jomo Kenyatta – gradually returned to the ways of the colonial master. The
                     government and the ruling political party, Kenya African National Union (KANU),
                     not only retained repressive colonial laws, but also became increasingly intolerant
                     of political dissent and opposition. Political assassinations and arbitrary detentions
                     were turned into potent tools for silencing dissenting voices and ultimately for
                     dismantling opposition political parties. For the larger part of Kenyatta’s reign
                     Kenya was a de facto one-party state.

             9.	     In addition to these vices, the resettlement of Kenyan citizens on lands that they
                     previously owned and lived on was riddled with corruption. As a consequence, many
                     including those who had put their lives on the line for liberty were left landless.
                     Moreover, ethnicity became rooted in political governance. By the time President
                     Kenyatta died in August 1978, the high expectations and hopes that accompanied
                     independence had been effectively dashed.

             10.	    Following the death of President Jomo Kenyatta, the then Vice-President, Daniel
                     Toroitich arap Moi, took over the presidency as directed by the constitution. Upon
                     his ascension to power, Moi ordered the release of political prisoners detained during
                     the Kenyatta era. This action suggested the entry of a leader who had the political
                     will to respect and protect human rights. However, his apparent goodwill did not last
                     long.

             11.	    The larger part of President Moi’s reign was characterised by intolerance to political
                     dissent. In June 1982, the government pushed through Parliament a constitutional
                     amendment that made the country a de jure one party state. In effect, KANU became
                     the only lawful political party in the country. Following an attempted coup in August
                     1982 the government resorted to even more vicious and repressive ways of dealing
                     with dissent.

                    A meeting between donors and TJRC international commisioners.



12.	   Political activists and individuals who dared oppose President Moi’s rule were
       routinely detained and tortured. Security agencies systematically committed untold
       atrocities against citizens they were sworn to protect. The judiciary became an
       accomplice in the perpetuation of violations, while parliament was transformed into
       a puppet controlled by the heavy hand of the executive. Corruption and especially
       the illegal and irregular allocation of land became institutionalised and normalised.
       Political patronage and centralisation of economic power in the hands of a few
       characterised the Moi era.

13.	   In 1991, in response to local and international pressure prompted by the end of
       the Cold War, President Moi yielded to demands for a multi-party state. However,
       political and ethnic violence, reportedly orchestrated by the state became integral
       to multi-party elections held in 1992 and 1997. Ethnicity was used as a political
       tool for accessing power and state resources and for fuelling violence.

14.	   By 2002, when KANU was dislodged from power by the National Rainbow Coalition
       (NARC), Kenya was a ravaged state with a history burdened by ghastly accounts
       of gross violations of human rights and historical injustices. In effect, the KANU
       government had created an authoritarian, oppressive and corrupt state. It created a
       traumatised nation of thousands of individuals living with physical and psychological
       wounds in a country that had no time or space for their experiences and stories. It

                     was a nation in which communities stood divided along ethnic and regional lines
                     suspicious and distrustful of one another. It was a nation that had to confront the
                     truth of its painful past and heal in order to chart the path towards a shared future.



             The Road to Establishing a Truth Commission
             15.	    The road to establishing a truth commission in Kenya was bumpy, long and marked
                     by several false starts. Advocacy for a truth commission initially emerged as part of
                     the campaigns for a multi-party system of governance. With the reintroduction of a
                     multi-party state in 1991, the campaign for a mechanism to address past injustices
                     was integrated into the wider campaign for a new constitution. It was, however,
                     only after KANU’s fall from power in 2002 and the ascendancy to power of the
                     NARC government that the official quest for a national transitional justice agenda
                     began to take root. Several key events led to the creation of the Truth, Justice and
                     Reconciliation Commission. A discussion of these events follows hereunder.

             NARC and the promise of a truth commission
             16.	    The 2002 general election, unlike preceding multi-party elections in 1992 and 1997,
                     was not characterised by political violence. Significantly, President Moi did not
                     contest the transfer of power to Mwai Kibaki. NARC came to power on a platform
                     that promised to curb and ultimately eliminate the political transgressions and
                     human rights violations that had been regularised during the 39 years of KANU’s
                     rule. NARC also pledged to address and rectify historical injustices. In his inaugural
                     speech to the country on the day he was sworn in as the third president of the
                     Republic of Kenya, Mwai Kibaki spelt out the vision of the new government - a
                     vision that embodied the pursuit of transitional justice:

                         One would have preferred to overlook some of the all too obvious human errors and
                         forge ahead, but it would be unfair to Kenyans not to raise questions about deliberate
                         actions or policies of the past that continue to have grave consequences on the present
                         […] We want to bring back the culture of due process, accountability and transparency
                         in public office. The era of ‘anything goes’ is gone forever. Government will no longer
                         be run on the whims of individuals. The era of roadside policy declarations is gone. My
                         government’s decisions will be guided by teamwork and consultations. The authority
                         of Parliament and the independence of the Judiciary will be restored and enhanced as
                         part of the democratic process and culture […] Corruption will now cease to be a way
                         of life in Kenya, and I call upon all those members of my government and public officers
                         accustomed to corrupt practices to know and clearly understand that there will be no
                         sacred cows under my government.

17.	   True to its commitment and in response to concerted calls by political activists
       and civil society organisations (CSOs) in the first few months of its operations the

The Task Force on Establishment of a Truth, Justice and
Reconciliation Commission

18.	   Of great importance was the establishment of the Task Force on the Establishment
       of a Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission in April 2003. The Task Force,
       chaired by Professor Makau Mutua, was mandated to recommend to the
       Minister for Justice, National Cohesion and Constitutional Affairs whether the
       establishment of a truth, justice and reconciliation commission was necessary for
       Kenya and if so to recommend:

       	   how and when such a commission should be established;

                      	   the membership of such a commission;
                      	   the terms of reference of such a commission;
                      	   the powers or privileges to be conferred upon the commission in execution of
                           its mandate; and
                      	   the historical period to be covered by the commission’s investigations.

             19.	    The Task Force was officially launched in May 2003. Soon thereafter it began to
                     conduct public hearings to solicit views that would form the basis of its findings and
                     recommendations. The Task Force commissioned research papers from individuals
                     who had studied truth commissions to inform its work. In addition, it convened an
                     international conference where experiences of truth commissions from around the
                     world were shared and explored.

             20.	    After a period of collecting and collating the views of Kenyans from across the
                     country, the Task Force concluded that a truth commission was necessary. It
                     recommended that a commission to be referred to as the ‘Truth, Justice and
                     Reconciliation Commission’, be established no later than June 2004. It summarised
                     the views of Kenyans thus:
                         The people of Kenya have spoken, and the Task Force is privileged to report that
                         Kenyans want a truth, justice, and reconciliation commission established immediately.
                         The overwhelming majority of Kenyans, over 90 per cent of those who submitted
                         their views to the Task Force, want the government to establish an effective truth
                         commission, a vehicle that will reveal the truth about past atrocities, name perpetrators,
                         provide redress for victims, and promote national healing and reconciliation. Kenyans
                         believe that a truth commission will renew the country’s morality in politics, law, in the
                         economy, and throughout the society. They want a state founded on the rule of law and
                         respect for the human rights of every individual who resides in Kenya. In other words,
                         Kenyans want a human rights state.2

             21.	    The recommendation by the Task Force that a truth commission be established
                     not later than June 2004 was informed by comparative experience that had
                     shown that truth commissions are effective when established within the first two
                     years of regime change. Studies suggest that where a truth commission is not
                     formed soon after regime change, the possibility that a government in office will
                     consolidate power and revert to practices that had in the first place warranted
                     the creation of a truth commission is high. Unfortunately, this turned out to be
                     the case in Kenya.

Retrogression to the past
22.	     The NARC government entered into office with a publicly declared commitment
         to address past injustices through reform and a number of stated activities
         Indeed, the Task Force cited some of these reforms and activities and concluded
         that they were ‘irrefutable testimonials of a break with the past and the
         undeniable transition which the state has embarked on’.3 Expectations were
         therefore high that a truth commission would be established in accordance with
         the recommendations of the Task Force.

23.	     As time passed, it became clear that the promise of change and the fanfare around
         it were not to be. It did not take long for observers and analysts to begin to point
         out that a number of old practices had started to slowly but steadily become part
         of the NARC government. Writing shortly after NARC came to power, Professor
         Crispin Odhiambo-Mbai (who would later be assassinated) warned that autocratic
         tendencies had begun to emerge in the Kibaki regime.4 He indicated that ‘a cabal of
         shadowy behind-the-scenes operating self-seekers’ were already building around
         Kibaki to promote narrow and regional interests and if this group were to succeed
         in its mission, then it would most likely ‘promote patronage and intrigue politics,
         which are some of the key characteristics of an autocratic state’. He proceeded to
         predict that:5
              The emergence of this cabal around the president is already creating intense power
              rivalry and division in the Kibaki government. If the bickering and divisions continue,
              the government will obviously fail to fulfil countless campaign pledges it made to the
              electorate and, therefore, the high expectations that the majority of Kenyans invested
              in the NARC government. This is bound to create discontent among the population
              who would react by challenging the government in various ways. To counter the
              challenges, the government may be tempted to result to repressive tendencies –
              another characteristic of an autocratic state.

24.	     It was, therefore, not surprising that June 2004 – the deadline that the Makau Mutua
         Task Force had set for the establishment of a truth commission – passed without the
         establishment of such a commission. Despite a de jure regime change it appeared
         the government was gradually retrogressing to past practices. In this particular
         case, the new government fell back on an old practice perfected under the previous
         regime: the government of President Moi had consistently and deliberately failed to
         implement recommendations of task forces and commissions of inquiry.

             25.	    Subsequent events confirmed the return to past practices and pointed to an
                     unspoken but evident decision to abandon the transitional justice agenda. Most
                     of the reforms and activities initiated in 2003 were abandoned midway or were
                     pursued with substantially reduced rigour and commitment. For instance:
                      	   The ‘Report of the Commission of Inquiry into the Illegal/Irregular Allocation
                           of Land’ was presented to the President in June 2004, but no immediate or
                           prompt actions were taken to implement its recommendations;

                      	   The Parliamentary Select Committee investigating the Death of Dr Robert
                           Ouko was dogged by controversy throughout its operations (including the
                           resignation of a number of Committee members and the refusal of other
                           Committee members to sign the final report). The Committee did not table its
                           Report before Parliament despite concluding its investigations in March 2005.
                           The Report was later tabled in Parliament in December 2010.

                      	   The inquest into the murder of Father John Kaiser was inconclusive. However,
                           the Presiding Magistrate recommended further investigations. Such further
                           investigations have never been conducted.

             The Constitution of Kenya Review Process
             26.	    An important process which returned Kenya to the old ways related to the process
                     of adopting a new constitution and the aftermath of this process. Upon coming
                     into power, the NARC government sought to bring to completion the constitutional
                     review process that had started but stalled under the previous government. As part
                     of its political campaign, NARC had promised to deliver a new constitution within
                     100 days if elected to power. On being elected, the NARC government reconvened
                     the National Constitutional Conference at Bomas of Kenya, Nairobi, for purposes of
                     discussing, debating, amending and adopting a draft constitution.

             27.	    Despite delays and many challenges that threatened to scuttle the renewed
                     constitutional review process, including the assassination of one of the delegates,
                     Prof Odhiambo-Mbai, the National Constitutional Conference adopted the Draft
                     Constitution of Kenya (popularly known as the ‘Bomas Draft’) on 23 March 2004.

             28.	    The constitutional review process revived calls for a transitional justice mechanism
                     to redress past injustices. In particular, during CKRC’s public hearings across the
                     country, Kenyans had asked for the creation of a commission which would deal with
                     past abuses and injustices.6 In response, the CKRC recommended the formation of a

        Commission for Human Rights and Administrative Justice. It would comprise of three
        individuals – the People’s Protector (Ombudsman), a Human Rights Commissioner,
        and a Gender Commissioner – with the general mandate to, inter alia:7

         	   investigate and establish, as complete a picture as possible, of the nature,
              causes and extent of gross violations of human rights;

         	   give an opportunity to victims and their families to relate the violations they
              suffered through hearings or other means;

         	   address the question of granting of amnesty to persons who were involved and
              who make disclosure of all the relevant acts associated with the crimes;

         	   make recommendations on reparation and the rehabilitation of the victims or
              families of the abused;

         	   propose measures aimed at the restoration of the human and civil dignity of
              victims; and

         	   report its findings to the nation.

29.	    Essentially, it had been envisaged that the Commission for Human Rights and
        Administrative Justice would have the mandate and discharge the functions
        of a truth commission. This recommendation was incorporated into the Draft
        Constitution of Kenya. The seventh schedule of the Bomas Draft addressed issues
        relating to the transitional period following the adoption of the Draft Constitution.
        Article 18 in particular dealt with the question of ‘past human rights abuses’ and
        provided as follows:
            Parliament shall, within six months after the effective date, enact a law to empower the
            Commission on Human Rights and Administrative Justice to –
            (a) 	 investigate all forms of human rights abuses by any person or group of persons before
                  the effective date;
            (b) 	investigate the causes of civil strife, including massacres, ethnic clashes and
                 political assassinations, and identify those responsible; and(c) make appropriate
                 recommendations regarding –
                  (i) 	 the prosecution of those responsible;
                  (ii) 	 the award of compensation to victims;
                  (iii) 	 reconciliation; and
                  (iv) 	 reparations.

             30.	    On receiving the Bomas Draft, however, the government altered its contents and
                     pushed through Parliament a revised draft (popularly known as the ‘Wako Draft’ - in
                     reference to the then Attorney-General Amos Wako, who crafted it). In contrast to
                     the Bomas Draft, the Wako Draft watered down legislative powers and retained most
                     of the presidential powers that many had hoped would be shared out to other arms
                     of government. It also diluted the devolution framework that had been proposed in
                     the Bomas Draft.

             31.	    The revision and dilution of the Bomas Draft led to a split of opinion in the
                     government, necessitating a referendum. Seven Cabinet members joined the
                     opposition in rallying the country to reject the Wako Draft. The members of
                     government supporting the adoption of the watered down draft campaigned
                     vigorously for the ratification of the Wako Draft. The campaign was filled with
                     distortions and ethnic-based incitements. Long standing political grievances were
                     revived during the referendum campaigns for or against the Draft.

             32.	    At the National Referendum held on 21 November 2005, 57 percent of Kenyans
                     rejected the Wako Draft. While the outcome of the referendum was accepted, the
                     referendum process had effectively exacerbated ethnic divisions in the country.
                     Following the conclusion of the referendum, the Kenya National Commission on
                     Human Rights (KNCHR) issued a report in which it concluded that:
                         The referendum was about a new constitutional dispensation only in name. Rather, it
                         was a moment to settle various political scores, up-end different political players, and
                         assert political superiority. And in this zero-sum game between politicians, ethnicity,
                         patronage and incitement became the preferred tools of the trade, with the people of
                         the country bearing the brunt of their antics.8

             33.	    Following the rejection of the Wako Draft, all pretensions by the government that it
                     was pursuing reforms and a transitional agenda faded. President Kibaki dissolved his
                     Cabinet and formed a government of national unity which incorporated prominent
                     members of the previous KANU government. The NARC members who had opposed
                     the proposed Constitution were dropped from Cabinet. They subsequently formed
                     the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM), while politicians and political parties
                     allied to the government, and President Kibaki in particular, formed the Party of
                     National Unity (PNU). The two parties, under the leadership of Raila Odinga and
                     President Mwai Kibaki respectively, would later be at the centre of the disputed 2007
                     Presidential election.

34.	     With the government having reneged on its general promise to pursue transitional
         justice, the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights (KNCHR) and civil society
         organisations continued to push for the formation of a truth commission. In
         particular, the KNCHR organised a series of events to honour and celebrate the life
         of prominent individuals who had been assassinated since Kenya’s independence.
         The first such event recalled the life of Tom Mboya and his assassination.9 The
         expectation of this particular event was two-fold:

          	   to educate the public on who Tom Mboya was and why his assassination must
               not be forgotten; and

          	   to enable the country to begin to understand the need to push for a truth
               commission to bring out the truth or as much of it as possible, regarding the
               assassination of Tom Mboya and others who had suffered in defence of human
               rights and political freedoms, as part of the mechanisms of transitional justice
               in Kenya.
	
	        However, these efforts did not yield any immediate results. In addition, the KNCHR
         and CSOs continued to work with victim groups in pushing for the establishment
         of a truth commission. In June 2006, they organized an international conference
         on transitional justice with the main objective of creating a forum for sharing
         comparative lessons on transitional justice mechanisms.

The 2007/2008 Post-Election Violence
35.	     Public debate on transitional justice resurfaced in the period running up to
         the 2007 general election. On 7 December 2007, Kituo cha Katiba organized a
         workshop in Nairobi on the theme ‘Revisiting Transitional Justice: A non-partisan
         and non-governmental engagement’. The objective of the workshop was to make
         truth and justice ‘an election issue Kenyans could vote on during the December
         2007 elections and to pressure politicians to state their stand on the issue’.10

36.	     Instead, political campaigns leading up to the general election were dominated
         by corruption, hate speech and negative ethnicity. In December 2007, the KNCHR
         published its second periodic report entitled ‘Still Behaving Badly’.11 The Report
         documented blatant violations of the electoral code, including misuse and
         misappropriation of public resources, the participation of public officers in political
         campaigns and incitement to and incidences of violence.

             37.	     The period towards the general election was also characterised by intense violent
                      activities by militia groups, especially the Mungiki sect and Sabaot Land Defence
                      Force (SLDF). The government responded to the violence with great force. In
                      November 2007, the KNCHR published a report on extra-judicial killings. The
                      report concluded that the police could be complicit in the killing of an estimated
                      500 individuals suspected to be members of the outlawed Mungiki sect,12 which
                      had wreaked terror in many parts of Central Kenya and areas of urban informal
                      settlements in the capital city Nairobi.

             38.	     Thus, the general elections of 27 December 2007 were conducted in a volatile
                      environment in which violence had been normalised and ethnic relations had
                      become poisoned. In effect, fertile ground had been prepared for the eruption of
                      violence. Therefore, when the results of the presidential election were disputed,
                      and both PNU and ODM claimed victory, violence erupted. The scale of the post-
                      election violence (PEV) was unprecedented. It lasted for a period of two months
                      and affected all but two provinces in the country.13 It is estimated that 1,133 people
                      succumbed to the violence while approximately 350 000, were displaced from
                      their homes14 and property worth billions of shillings destroyed through arson and
                      other forms of attacks. It was the darkest episode in Kenya’s post-independence
                      history.


             Kenya National Dialogue and Reconciliation
             39.	     News of the PEV quickly spread across the world. Shocking images of a nation
                      engulfed by violence were splashed on local and international media outlets. Yet,
                      the protagonists at the centre of the disputed presidential election, President Mwai
                      Kibaki of PNU and Raila Odinga of ODM (hereinafter referred to as the Principals),
                      took hard-line positions, each insisting they had won.

             40.	 The international community, with the African Union (AU) taking a lead,
                  responded almost instantly, with all efforts channelled towards unlocking
                  the political gridlock and bringing to cessation the violence that was steadily
                  pushing the country towards disintegration.15 From 8 to 10 January 2008, then
                  AU Chairman, His Excellency John Agyekum Kufuor, President of Ghana, visited
                  the country and initiated a mediation process between the Principals. After he

         left, and with the blessings of the two Principals, the mediation process was
         taken over by a three-member Panel of Eminent African Personalities (hereafter
         referred to as the Panel) composed of three African icons: former United Nations
         (UN) Secretary-General Kofi Annan, former Mozambican Minister and First Lady
         Graça Machel and former President of the United Republic of Tanzania Benjamin
         Mkapa.

41.	     The Panel, chaired by Kofi Annan, arrived in Kenya on 22 January 2008 and
         immediately proceeded to hold meetings with relevant stakeholders. Two days
         later, on 24 January 2008, the Panel managed to convene a meeting between the
         two Principals. A few days later, on 29 January 2008, the Kenya National Dialogue
         and Reconciliation (KNDR) was formally launched by the Principals in the presence
         of the Panel.

42.	 With the Panel as mediators, the KNDR negotiations were conducted by
     representatives of the two opposing sides: the PNU side was represented by Cabinet
     ministers Martha Karua, Sam Ongeri, Moses Wetangula and Mutula Kilonzo, while
     the ODM side was represented by Musalia Mudavadi, James Orengo, William Ruto,
     and Sally Kosgei.

43.	     The negotiating team agreed on an agenda comprising four main items:16

          	    immediate action to stop the PEV and restore fundamental rights and liberties;
          	    immediate measures to address the humanitarian crisis, promote reconciliation,
                healing and restoration;
          	    how to overcome the political crisis; and

          	    address long-term issues and solutions.

44.	     In respect to Agenda Items 1 to 3, the negotiation team concluded a series
         of public agreements, laying out the agreed modalities for implementing the
         broader objective of the KNDR process, which was ‘to achieve sustainable peace,
         stability and justice in Kenya through the rule of law and respect for human
         rights’.

          	    Agreed Statement on Security Measures, 1 February 2008. Under this
                Agreement, the parties committed themselves to take action to halt the
                violence. The Agreement called on the police to act in accordance with the
                law and to carry out their duties and responsibilities with impartiality. It called

                            2008. This Agreement laid out measures for the assistance and protection of
                            internally displaced persons (IDPs). It also proposed the operationalisation of
                            the Humanitarian Fund for Mitigation of Effects and Resettlement of Victims of
                            Post-2007 Election Violence. With respect to immediate measures to promote
                            reconciliation, healing and restoration, the Agreement proposed that a truth,
                            justice and reconciliation commission that includes local and international
                            jurists should be established.

                            This Agreement, in the first instance, outlined a number of options that were
                            available for resolving the political crisis, with the strengths and weaknesses
                            of each option. It then charted the way forward, including: a forensic audit
                            of the electoral process; comprehensive constitutional reform; establishment
                            of a truth, justice and reconciliation commission; and the identification and
                            prosecution of perpetrators of PEV.

             45.	     On 28 February 2008, after 41 days of intense mediation,17 the formal negotiations
                      were concluded with the signing of the Agreement on the Principles of Partnership
                      of the Coalition Government (hereinafter referred to as the Coalition Agreement)
                      between the Principals. Upon the signing of the Coalition Agreement the PEV
                      ceased.

46.	    On the basis of the Coalition Agreement, the National Assembly enacted the
        National Accord and Reconciliation Act on 18 March 2008. The National Accord
        paved way for the establishment of a coalition government and the offices of
        Prime Minister as well as those of two Deputy Prime Ministers.

47.	    Following the signing of the Coalition Agreement, the Panel appointed Ambassador
        Oluyemi Adeniji, a former Minister of Foreign Affairs of Nigeria, to conclude
        negotiations on Agenda Item Four. On 4 March 2008, the following agreements
        were signed.

         	   General Principles and Parameters for the Inde-pendent Review Committee
              on the 2007 General Elections (IREC). Pursuant to this Agreement and the
              Commissions of Inquiry Act, the Independent Review Commission headed by
              Justice Johann Kriegler of South Africa was appointed on 14 March 2008. After
              conducting a forensic audit of the electoral process IREC concluded that the
              polling process was undetectably perverted and that the recorded and reported
              results were so inaccurate as to render any reasonably accurate, reliable and
              convincing conclusion impossible.18

         	   General Principles and Parameters for the Commission of Inquiry into
              the Post Election Violence (CIPEV). This Agreement, together with the
              Commissions of Inquiry Act, formed the basis for the appointment of a
              Commission of Inquiry into Post Election Violence (CIPEV) headed by Justice
              Philip Waki on 22 May 2008. The CIPEV carried out investigations and issued its
              report in October 2008. The Report found that while the PEV was spontaneous
              in some areas, it was planned and financed in other places.19

	       CIPEV generated a sealed list of individuals alleged to have borne the greatest
        responsibility for the PEV and recommended the formation of a special tribunal,
        within a specified time, for the prosecution of these individuals, failing which
        the list would be handed over to the Prosecutor of the International Criminal
        Court (ICC) for appropriate action. Parliament failed to establish such a tribunal
        within the specified time and the sealed list of names was as a result handed
        over to the then ICC Chief Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo. A series of events
        followed thereafter, leading to the indictment of six Kenyan individuals before
        the ICC.
         	   General Principles and Parameters for the Truth, Justice and Reconciliation
              Commission (TJRC Agreement). This Agreement formed the basis for the

                            establishment of the Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission (TJRC). The
                            details of the Agreement are discussed in detail below.

                       	   Roadmap for a Comprehensive Constitutional Review Process. This
                            Agreement outlined a five-step process for the enactment of a new constitution.
                            It formed the basis for the enactment of the Constitution of Kenya Review Act
                            2008 and the appointment on 23 February 2009 of a Committee of Experts (CoE)
                            charged with the function of spearheading the constitutional review process.
                            After an elaborate consultative process, the CoE produced the proposed new
                            Constitution of Kenya, which was subjected to a national referendum on 4 August
                            2010. The referendum returned positive results, leading to the promulgation of
                            the new Constitution of the Republic of Kenya on 27 August 2010.

             48.	     On May 28 2008, the KNDR parties signed another agreement in which they
                      reaffirmed their commitment to address long-term issues listed under the KNDR
                      Agenda Item Four.20 The KNDR process came to a formal end on 30 July 2008, with
                      the adoption of an Implementation Framework. The Implementation Framework
                      indicated action points, timeframes and focal points for each of the issues identified
                      under Agenda Item Four.


             The TJRC Agreement

             49.	     The TJRC Agreement spelt out the general parameters, guiding principles and the
                      broad rules that would govern the creation and operation of the Commission. In
                      particular, the following general parameters were agreed upon:

                       	   A truth, justice and reconciliation commission was to be created through an
                            Act of Parliament and adopted by the Legislature within four weeks.

                       	   The Commission would inquire into human rights violations, including
                            those committed by the State, groups or individuals. Such inquiry was to
                            include but not be limited to politically-motivated violence, assassinations,
                            community displacements, settlements and evictions. The Commission was
                            also to inquire into major economic crimes, in particular grand corruption,
                            historical land injustices and the illegal and irregular acquisition of land,
                            especially as related to conflict or violence. Other historical injustices were
                            also to be investigated.

                       	   The Commission was to inquire into events which took place between
                            December 12, 1963 and February 28, 2008. However, it was also mandated to

18           REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION
                                                                                      Vol u m e I   Chapter ONE




            look at antecedents to this period where necessary in order to understand the
            nature, root causes, and context that led to such violations, violence, or crimes.

       	   The Commission was to receive statements from victims, witnesses, communities,
            interest groups, persons directly or indirectly involved in events, or any other
            group or individual; undertake investigations and research; hold hearings;
            and engage in activities as it determined to advance national or community
            reconciliation. The Commission was permitted to offer confidentiality to
            persons upon request, in order to protect individual privacy or security, or for
            other reasons. The determination as to whether to hold its hearings in public or
            in camera was left to the sole discretion of the Commission.

       	   Blanket amnesty would not be provided for past crimes. Provision was made for
            the proposed commission to recommend individual amnesty in exchange for
            the full truth. Serious international crimes including crimes against humanity,
            war crimes, or genocide were not amnestied, nor were persons who bore the
            greatest responsibility for crimes that the Commission would cover.

       	   The Commission was to complete its work and submit a final report within two
            years. The final report was to state its findings and recommendations which
            would be submitted to the President, and made public within fourteen (14)
            days before being tabled in Parliament.

50.	   It was also agreed that the proposed Commission would reflect the following
       principles and guidelines, taking into account international standards and best
       practices:

       	   Independence: The Commission was to operate free from political or other
            influence. It would determine its own specific working methodologies and
            work plan, including those adopted for investigation and reporting. It would
            also set out its own budget and staff plan.

       	   Fair and balanced inquiry: In all its work, the Commission was to ensure that it
            sought the truth without influence from other factors. In representations to the
            public through hearings, statements, or in its final report, the Commission was
            to ensure that a fair representation of the truth was provided.

       	   Appropriate powers: The Commission was given powers of investigation,
            including the right to call persons to speak with the Commission and powers
            to make recommendations to be considered and implemented by the
            government or others. These recommendations could include measures to
            advance community or national reconciliation; institutional or other reforms,
            or whether any persons were to be held to account for past acts.

Volume I   Chapter ONE




                     	   Full cooperation: Government and other state offices were to provide information
                          to the Commission on request, and to provide access to archives or other sources
                          of information. Other Kenyan and international individuals and organizations
                          were also urged to provide full cooperation and information to the Commission
                          on request.

                     	   Financial support: the parties were to encourage strong financial support to the
                          Commission. The Government of Kenya was expected to provide a significant
                          portion of the Commission’s budget. Other funding could be obtained by the
                          Commission from donors, foundations, or other independent sources.

             51.	    On the composition of the Commission, the TJRC Agreement stated that:

                     	   The Commission would consist of seven members, with gender balance taken
                          into account. Three of the members were to be international. The members
                          were to be persons of high moral integrity, well regarded by the Kenyan
                          population, and to possess a range of skills, backgrounds, and professional
                          expertise. As a whole, the Commission was to be perceived as impartial and
                          no member was to be seen to represent a specific political group. At least two
                          and not more than five of the seven commissioners were to be lawyers.

                     	   In keeping with international best practices and to ensure broad public trust in
                          and ownership of the process of seeking the truth, the national members of the
                          Commission were chosen through a consultative process. The Commissioners
                          were to be named no more than eight weeks after the passage of the Act that
                          established the Commission.

                     	   The three international members were to be selected by the Panel of Eminent
                          African Personalities, taking into account public input.

             The legislative process
             52.	    Parties to the TJRC Agreement had anticipated that the Commission would be
                     created within four weeks of signing the Agreement. This timeline was both
                     ambitious and impractical for two significant reasons. Firstly, four weeks was
                     too short a period for the legislative cycle to run full course, considering that
                     the National Assembly was required to enact several other pieces of legislation
                     emanating from the KNDR process.

             53.	    Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, four weeks was too short a period to allow
                     for sufficient consultations with and meaningful participation of stakeholders in
                     the legislative process. The legislative process officially commenced on 9 May 2008,

                 In keeping with international best practices and to ensure
                broad public trust in and ownership of the process of seeking
                  the truth, the national members of the Commission were
                            chosen through a consultative process.


        with the publication in the Kenya Gazette of the Truth, Justice and Reconciliation
        Commission Bill by the Ministry of Justice, National Cohesion and Constitutional
        Affairs (Ministry of Justice).21 This was slightly more than one month outside the
        timeline given in the TJRC Agreement.

54.	    The publication of the Bill was greeted with much criticism, especially because
        stakeholders claimed that they had not been meaningfully engaged in its
        drafting. Moreover, several of its provisions on the mandate and operations of a
        truth commission (such as provisions on amnesty) did not reflect internationally
        accepted standards. This prompted civil society organizations to prepare reviews
        of the Bill for consideration by the Ministry of Justice and the National Assembly.

55.	    The Multi-Sectoral Task Force on the TJRC, an umbrella body of CSOs which
        later evolved into the Kenya Transitional Justice Network, prepared a detailed
        memorandum proposing amendments to the TJRC Bill, especially in relation to its
        provisions on the following: objectives and functions of the Commission; economic
        crimes; independence of the Commission; amnesty; and implementation of the
        recommendations of the Commission.22 Amnesty International raised similar issues
        and even expanded the concerns.23

56.	    Some of the concerns and proposals made by the various CSOs were taken up
        by the Ministry of Justice and ultimately by the National Assembly. For example,
        the hitherto broad amnesty provisions were amended to allow for conditional
        amnesty for a very narrow list of crimes.

57.	    After going through the full legislative cycle, the Truth, Justice and Reconciliation
        Act became law on 23 October 2008. The Act received Presidential Assent on 28
        November 2008 and came into operation on 17 March 2009.

Volume I   Chapter ONE




             Establishment of the Commission
             58.	     There were three milestones in the establishment of the Commission: the selection
                      and appointment of Commissioners, their inauguration, and the setting up of the
                      Commission. These three milestones are discussed here in turn.


             Selection and appointment of Commissioners
             59.	     The TJR Act provided for the appointment of nine Commissioners; six Kenyan
                      citizens appointed through a national consultative process and three non-citizens
                      selected by the African Union Panel of Eminent African Personalities. The Act
                      required gender equity (and geographical balance in the case of Kenyan citizens)
                      in the selection of the Commissioners.24

             60.	 The selection of the Kenyan Commissioners was done through a broadly
                  consultative process that involved civil society and Parliament.25 The process
                  began with the creation of a Selection Panel composed of nine individuals
                  nominated by various religious and professional organisations in the following
                  proportion:

                       	    two individuals nominated by a joint forum of religious organisations;

                       	    one person nominated by the Law Society of Kenya (LSK);

                       	    one person nominated by the Federation of Women Lawyers (FIDA Kenya)

                       	    one person jointly nominated by the Central Organisation of Trade Unions
                             (COTU) and the Kenya National Union of Teachers (KNUT);

                       	    one person nominated by the Association of Professional Societies of East Africa;

                       	    one person nominated by the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights
                             (KNCHR);

                       	 one    person jointly nominated by the Kenya Private Sector Alliance and the
                             Federation of Kenya Employers (FKE); and

                       	    one person nominated by the Kenya Medical Association (KMA).26

22           REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION
                                                                                                                     Vol u m e I   Chapter ONE




61.	     In April 2009, the Selection Panel placed an advertisement in the Kenya Gazette
         and in three daily newspapers inviting applications from persons who met the
         qualifications set forth in the Act for nomination as commissioners. The Act required
         that the Commissioners include individuals with knowledge and experience in
         human rights law, forensic audit, investigations, psycho-sociology, anthropology,
         social relations, conflict management, religion and gender issues.

62.	     The Act also included a broadly worded qualification designed to protect the
         process and the broad mandate of the Commission from any interference due to
         conflict of interest. The Act thus required that commissioners be persons who had
         ‘not in any way been involved, implicated, linked or associated with human rights
         violations of any kind or in any matter which is to be investigated under this Act’.27

63.	     The Selection Panel sub-contracted a human resources firm to conduct short-
         listing of applicants on its behalf. The firm received a total of 254 applications. Out
         of these, 47 applicants were selected for interview by the Panel. After conducting
         interviews, 15 names were forwarded to the National Assembly for consideration.
         The National Assembly deliberated the suitability of the 15 individuals and
         narrowed the number of candidates to nine.28 The Panel of Eminent African
         Personalities forwarded three names to the National Assembly, which in turn
         forwarded those names together with those of the nine Kenyans to the President.

64.	     By Gazette Notice dated 22 July 2009, the President appointed the following nine
         individuals to serve as members of the Commission:29

          	    Bethuel Kiplagat (Kenya);

          	    Kaari Betty Murungi (Kenya);

          	    Tecla Namachanja Wanjala (Kenya);

          	    Gertrude Chawatama (Zambia);

          	    Berhanu Dinka (Ethiopia);

          	    Ahmed Sheikh Farah (Kenya);

          	    Tom Ojienda (Kenya);

27	 TJR Act, sec 10(6) (b).
28	 Prior to the amendment of the Act in July 2009, the First Schedule did not specify the number of individuals to be forwarded
    from the National Assembly to the President. As such, the National Assembly forwarded nine (9) names to the President from
    whom he was required to appoint six as commissioners. Later, the Act was amended to require Parliament to forward only six
    names to the President, but this amendment was of no effect because it had been overtaken by events.
29	 See Appendix 1 for the personal profiles of the Commissioners.

Volume I   Chapter ONE




                      	    Margaret Shava (Kenya); and
                      	    Ronald Slye (United States).

             65.	     From among the Commissioners, the President appointed Ambassador Bethuel
                      Kiplagat as Chairperson to the Commission. The President also appointed
                      Betty Murungi as Vice-Chairperson, though the Act made it clear that the Vice-
                      Chairperson was to be chosen by the Commissioners themselves and not the
                      President.30 Shortly after the members of the Commission were appointed, the
                      Cabinet issued a statement indicating that instead of establishing a special tribunal
                      to try those who were allegedly responsible for the 2007/2008 Post Election
                      Violence, it would be seeking an expansion of the Commission’s to include dealing
                      with these cases. This decision was highly criticized by a broad sector of Kenyan
                      society and would later have an impact on the work of the Commission although
                      the decision never saw the light of day. Firstly, the decision created the impression
                      that the government was inclined to using the Commission as a shield against
                      those who were alleged to bear responsibility for the PEV. Secondly, a section
                      of CSOs and donors resolved not to work with or fund the Commission until the
                      Cabinet’s decision is reversed.

             Inauguration of the Commission
             66.	     The Commissioners were sworn into office on 3 August 2009. As is discussed in
                      Chapter Four of this Report, the oath of office taken by the Commissioners was one
                      of the grounds on which a group of activists filed legal suit challenging the existence
                      of the Commission.31

             67.	     During their inaugural meeting, and in accordance with Section 11(2) of the TJR
                      Act, Commissioners elected Betty Murungi as the Vice-Chairperson. However,
                      as will be discussed in detail later, Betty Murungi subsequently resigned, first as
                      Vice-Chairperson and then as a Commissioner. While the President was required
                      to gazette her vacancy within seven days of her resignation so that a replacement
                      could be chosen, such notice was never published and thus no replacement was
                      ever provided.

             68.	 From mid-April 2010 the Commission operated with only eight full-time
                  Commissioners. When Ambassador Kiplagat stepped aside in November 2010 for
                  sixteen months, the Commission operated with only seven full-time Commissioners.

                                                                                 Vol u m e I   Chapter ONE




69.	   With the resignation of Betty Murungi as Vice Chairperson, Tecla Namachanja
       Wanjala was elected the Commission’s Vice-Chairperson. She later served as the
       Commission’s Acting Chairperson from 2 November 2010 to 27 February 2012
       while Ambassador Kiplagat had temporarily stepped aside from office.

Foundational Tasks
70.	   The TJR Act Setting up the Commission involved four foundational tasks:

       	   establishing the Commission’s secretariat;

       	   developing internal policy and procedural documents to guide the work of
            the Commission;

       	   conceptualising and interpreting the Commission’s mandate; and

       	   informing the public about the Commission’s existence and the purpose of its
            work.

71.	   Chapter Two of this volume of the Report discusses in detail the Commission’s
       interpretation of its mandate while Chapter Three outlines the Commission’s
       endeavour to inform the public of its existence and work.

72.	   The detailed aspects of these foundational tasks were performed by nine thematic
       working groups. Initially, budget constraints delayed the recruitment of staff and
       the working groups were each composed of three or four Commissioners. The
       working groups were as follows:

       	   Structure Working Group
       	   Gender Working Group
       	   Stakeholder Collaboration Working Group
       	   Rules of Procedure Working Group
       	   Human Resources Working Group
       	   Security Working Group
       	   Outreach and Public Awareness Working Group
       	   Internal Rules and Policy Working Group
       	   Communications and Media Working Group
       	   Legal Affairs Working Group

             Internal Policies
             73.	    The administrative operations of the Commission were guided by, among others,
                     the following internal policy and procedural documents: Staff Employment
                     Policy; Staff Code of Conduct and Confidentiality Agreement; and Security Policy.

                     	   Employment Policy: The Employment Policy was the basic policy document
                          which defined the relationship between the Commission and its employees,
                          including the rights and responsibilities of each party. It served as a rich source
                          of information about the Commission’s working conditions, benefits and policies.
                          Each staff member was expected to be acquainted with and abide by the
                          Employment Policy in the conduct of their duties and in their general deportment.

                     	   Code of Conduct and Confidentiality Agreement: Employees of the
                          Commission were required to abide by a code of conduct and take an oath of
                          confidentiality. In signing the document Commission staff undertook:
                          	not   to reveal any information that they came across in the course of their
                             work. Such information included, but was not limited, to the names of the
                             victims and witnesses or adversely mentioned persons and the specific details
                             of their statements, pictures, reports, and documents of the Commission. This
                             restriction would apply both during the period of their employment and
                             thereafter;
                          	to   deal with witnesses with compassion and respect for their dignity;
                          	not   to reveal or otherwise discuss with anyone outside the Commission
                             information regarding the internal operations and activities of the Commission;
                          	to  bring to the immediate attention of the Director of Finance and
                             Administration or Chief Executive Officer any breach of the Code of Conduct
                             that they become aware of;
                          	to promptly deliver to the Commission all property of the Commission
                             whenever requested or in any event upon termination of employment;
                          	not to engage in other employment or activities that could result in a conflict
                             of interest (including the reasonable perception of a conflict of interest) with
                             their employment in the Commission.
                          	not  to give press or other media interviews, on or off the record, without
                             express written authority from the Director of Communications or the
                             Chief Executive Officer.

                     	   Security Policy: This document laid out measures relating to the security of the
                          Commissioners, the Commission’s staff, and witnesses who interacted with the
                          Commission.

Management and Administration
Organisational structure
74.	     The Commission’s organisational structure was designed with the assistance of an
         independent consultant. Later, a five-member team comprising officers from the
         Ministry of Justice, National Cohesion and Constitutional Affairs (Ministry of Justice)
         and Ministry of State for Public Service was assigned to support the Commission
         with this task. However, as is discussed below in detail, the Commission’s
         organizational structure was not approved.

75.	     The functions and objectives of the Commission were discharged by Commissioners
         who were positioned at the apex of the Commission’s organisational structure.
         According to the TJR Act, the overall task of supervising and directing the work of
         the Commission rested with the chairperson.32 It also indicated that the chairperson
         would preside over all meetings of the Commission and was its spokesperson.33

76.	     The TJR Act allowed the Commission to establish such committees as it considered
         necessary for the better performance of its functions. Pursuant to this provision,
         the Commission established seven committees that fell under two broad
         categories: mandate and administrative committees. Mandate committees were
         responsible for guiding, both conceptually and practically, the Commission’s
         execution of its substantive mandate. There were four such committees:
         	    Human Rights Violations Committee;
         	    Reparations and Rehabilitation Committee;
         	    Reconciliation Committee; and
         	    Amnesty Committee.

77.	     Administrative committees provided policy guidance for the daily functioning of
         the Commission. Three committees and one sub-committee were established for
         this purpose:
         	    Committee on Finance and Administration and its sub-committee on
               Recruitment and Human Resources;
         	    Committee on Logistics, Security and Procurement; and
         	    Committee on Communications and Civic Education.

Volume I   Chapter ONE




             78.	     The Commission’s Secretariat was headed by the Secretary to the Commission who
                      was also its Chief Executive Officer.34 The CEO was responsible for the day-to-day
                      administration and management of the affairs of the Commission.35

             79.	     The technical operations of the Commission were carried out by eight departments,
                      each headed by a Director responsible for directing, supervising and coordinating
                      work within their respective departments. The eight departments were as follows:
                      	    Civic Education and Outreach;
                      	    Research;
                      	    Investigations;
                      	    Legal Affairs;
                      	    Special Support Services;
                      	    Communications;
                      	    Finance and Administration; and
                      	    Documentation and Information Management.

             80.	     Although the various units had specific terms of reference, their operations were
                      harmonised to ensure coherence and efficiency in the execution of the Commission’s
                      mandate. The work of each department fed into and informed the work of the other
                      units. This was facilitated by periodic meetings of all Directors which allowed each
                      department to learn about and contribute to the work of the other departments.

                      	    Civic Education and Outreach Department: This Department was responsible
                            for educating, engaging, and encouraging the public to contribute positively
                            to the achievement of the objectives of the Commission. In particular, the
                            Unit: (a) coordinated the dissemination of information about the Commission
                            to the general public through education and public awareness campaigns
                            and other forums; (b) coordinated reconciliation initiatives; and (c) developed
                            and updated the Commission’s civic education and advocacy materials.
                            The Department became operational in August 2010, with the hiring of the
                            Director Civic Education and Outreach, together with two programme officers.

                      	    Research Department: The Research Department was responsible for
                            three broad tasks: conducting research into all aspects of the Commission’s
                            substantive mandate; servicing the research needs of other departments of the
                            Commission; and coordinating the writing of the Report of the Commission.

	   Investigations Department: The Investigations Department’s primary role was
     to collect, analyze and provide accurate information to enable the Commission
     to build a complete historical record and picture of gross human rights violations.
     In particular, the Department was responsible for: identifying and interviewing
     victims and witnesses; collection and recovery of evidence from victims and
     witnesses; and mapping out areas identified as scenes of gross violations of
     human rights for the Commission’s site visits.

	   Legal Affairs Department: The Legal Affairs Department was responsible for
     handling all legal matters related to the Commission’s execution of its mandate.
     The Department was also responsible for organizing and coordinating the
     conduct of the Commission’s hearings. It was also involved in training of
     relevant stakeholders (e.g. lawyers) on matters pertaining to the Commission’s
     mandate.

	   Special Support Department: This Department was established pursuant to
     section 27 of the TJR Act, which provided that the Commission could put in
     place special arrangements and adopt specific mechanisms and procedures
     to address the experiences of women, children, persons with disabilities
     (PWD), and other vulnerable groups. Its primary role was to ensure that the
     situation and experiences of these vulnerable groups were consistently and
     adequately addressed in all the processes of the Commission. In this regard,
     it was responsible for coordinating the provision of counselling services to
     victims and witnesses and generally catering for their welfare, including their
     accommodation and travel needs. The Department was also responsible
     for the organisation of the women’s hearings and the thematic hearings on
     children and persons with disabilities.

	   The Communications Department: This Department was the link between
     the Commission and the media and by extension between the Commission
     and the general public. The Department managed the Commission’s media
     and public relations.

	   The Finance and Administration Department: The Department of Finance
     and Administration was responsible for provision of logistical and administrative
     support to the Commission. This included the procurement of goods and
     services and the preparation and management of the Commission’s budget and
     finance.

	   ICT and Documentation Department: the ICT and Documentation Department
     was responsible for the management and provision of the Commission’s
     information and communication technology needs. It was also charged with
     the custody of all records and documents and the creation and maintenance of
     the database and the Commission’s website.

                  Recruitment of staff
                  81.	       The Commission was permitted by its enabling legislation to appoint officers and
                             other staff as considered necessary for the proper performance of its functions.36
                             However, due to lack of funds, the Commission operated with neither a secretary
                             nor a secretariat during its first fiscal year (2009-2010). During this period,
                             Commissioners performed most of the administrative and organisational work
                             with the assistance of a 17 member support staff seconded to the Commission by
                             the Ministry of Justice.

30                REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION
                                                                                               Vol u m e I   Chapter ONE




82.	     The Commission commenced its recruitment process in February 2010 with
         the hiring of the Secretary/Chief Executive Officer. Most line directors and staff
         were hired in August 2010 and the various departments commenced operations
         around September 2010. At the height of its operations, the Commission had
         a total of 150 members of staff.37 This number was gradually reduced as the
         Commission approached the conclusion of its term. Thus, as at 4 November 2012,
         the initial date for its closure, the Commission had a total of 60 members of staff.
         However, upon receiving a further extension of its term, and as part of its efforts
         to finalize all pending mandate operations, the Commission in January 2013 re-
         hired staff.
 
	       Victims as staff
83.	     In August 2010, the Commission recruited 304 statement takers and deployed them
         across the country to take statements from victims, their families and witnesses.
         Amongst those recruited were individuals who were victims of violations that fell
         under the Commission’s mandate and scope of inquiry. Sections of civil society and
         others raised the concern that engaging victims as staff of the Commission was
         inappropriate. They argued that victims would be partial by virtue of their experience
         and their engagement as staff of the Commission would compromise the statement
         taking process.

84.	     The Commission did not take these concerns lightly. The decision to engage
         victims as staff members was based on comparative experience. Many truth
         commissions across the world have involved victims. Some of the best known truth
         commissions have had victims as Commissioners and Chairpersons; for example,
         Archbishop Desmond Tutu chaired the South Africa’s Truth and Reconciliation
         Commission. Truth commissions are designed to be victim-centred, though not
         victim-dominated, processes. Engagement of victims facilitates access to victim
         communities, and promotes ownership and legitimacy of the process. The right
         to effective remedy requires that victims are involved in the processes of finding
         solutions to and redress for violations.

85.	     Therefore, the question before the Commission was not whether to engage victims
         but in what capacity and under what terms. Firstly, victims had to qualify for the
         position they applied for just like any other applicant and go through the interview
         process. Secondly, the Commission limited the recruitment of victims to statement
         takers and civic educators. In the area of statement taking the Commission also
         adopted the policy that any individual could request a different statement taker

                     than the one before them, thus ensuring that individuals who gave statements were
                     provided the safest and most effective environment in which to tell their stories.
                     Victims were not hired as investigators or as researchers, or in any positions which
                     involved analysis of violations and identifying those responsible for such violations.
                     In addition, the Commission took measures to ensure that cases of conflict of interest
                     were minimised.

             86.	    The engagement of victims by the Commission also had an important reparatory
                     dimension to it. It symbolised restoration and affirmation of the dignity of victims
                     and their right to access employment in formal institutions. As documented in
                     the ‘Torture and Detentions’ Chapter in Volume Two of this Report, the majority
                     of victims of torture and detention under President Moi’s regime remained
                     unemployed, decades later. Those who were university students at the time of their
                     detention and torture had their education and careers abruptly and indefinitely cut
                     short. Members of the Kenya Air Force who were suspected to have been behind
                     or supported the 1982 attempted coup d’état, had their careers in the armed forces
                     abruptly terminated and the stigma surrounding their discharge from the Force
                     made it impossible to secure employment in any formal institution.

             87.	    The small number of victims that the Commission engaged as statement takers and
                     civic educators expressed gratitude that such an opportunity had been offered to
                     them.38

             	      Database Manager and Director Investigations
             88.	    Due to the sensitive nature of the information collected by the Commission and the
                     unfortunate ethnic suspicions that have traditionally greeted public appointments
                     in Kenya, the Commission decided that the positions of Database Manager and
                     Director Investigations would be held by non-Kenyans. It was important for
                     the Commission to take this position given that perceptions of bias could be
                     heightened if Kenyan citizens were to hold these offices. In line with this policy
                     decision, the Commission hired a national of India as its Database Manager and a
                     national of New Zealand as its Director of Investigations.

             89.	 The remaining professional positions within the Commission were filled by
                  Kenyans. It is noteworthy that at no point did the Commission have reason to be
                  concerned about the actual bias of any staff member, whether Kenyan or foreign.

                                                                                                      Vol u m e I   Chapter ONE




	       Staffing and gender balance
90.	     In line with the TJR Act,39 and its Gender Policy, the Commission ensured that all
         its appointments were made with regard to the principle of gender equality. The
         Commission maintained a gender balance in its staff composition, not simply in keeping
         with a statutory requirement, but more importantly because it wished to ensure
         that women accessed its processes with relative ease. Studies and the experience
         of truth commissions have shown that having more women on staff may make a
         commission less alienating for female victims.40 In this regard, gender as a factor in the
         Commission’s recruitment process, was particularly important for positions involving
         certain responsibilities such as statement taking, investigations, victim support, and
         leading evidence.

91.	     To ensure that it lived up both to its own expectations and those of the TJR Act,
         the Commission periodically assessed its staff composition in terms of gender.
         Throughout the life of the Commission, the representation of women in its staff body
         was consistently above 40 percent. At the decision making level, the Commission
         was led by a female Chief Executive Officer from February 2010 to September 2012,
         and the ratio of female decision-makers (directorate level), stood at 50 percent
         during the same period.


National and regional offices

92.	 The TJR Act designated Nairobi as the Commission’s headquarters. Between
     2009 and 2010 the Commission had its offices at Delta House, Westlands. The
     office space at Delta House was found to be inadequate accommodation for the
     Commission’s staffing and other needs. In January 2011, the Commission moved to
     NHIF Building, where it was housed for the remainder of its tenure.

93.	     In order to decentralise its presence and reach out to as many Kenyans as possible, the
         Commission established regional offices in Eldoret, Garissa, Kisumu and Mombasa.
         Each regional office had a regional coordinator and an assistant regional coordinator
         of the opposite gender. The regional offices were responsible for facilitating all
         administrative support services of the Commission within the respective regions.
         They took the lead in mobilising individuals to attend the Commission’s processes.
         They also served as central collection points for statements and memoranda within
         the regions.

Volume I   Chapter ONE




             94.	     The Eldoret and Mombasa offices served Rift Valley and Coast Provinces respectively.
                      The Kisumu office served Western and Nyanza Provinces, while the Garissa office served
                      North Eastern Province and the upper region of Eastern Province. The Commission’s
                      headquarters in Nairobi was host to the regional office for Central Province, Nairobi
                      Province (including Kajiado County) and the lower region of Eastern Province.

             Finance
             95.	     Sections 43 to 47 of the TJR Act provided for the establishment and management
                      of the Commission’s funds, which consisted mainly of monies appropriated from
                      the Consolidated Fund. The Commission’s funds were managed by the Ministry of
                      Justice during the first fiscal year of establishment and by its Secretary during the
                      remainder of its tenure. The Accounts Unit, comprising an Assistant Director, an
                      accountant and two assistants, was responsible for running the day-to-day financial
                      operations of the Commission. At the level of the Commissioners’ the Finance and
                      Administration Committee was responsible for formulating financial policies and
                      exercised an oversight role in relation to all matters of finance and administration.

             96.	     In accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, as read with the
                      TJR Act and the Government Financial Management Act, the Commission prepared
                      financial statements for each fiscal year of its existence with the exception of
                      fiscal year 2009-2010 during which - as earlier mentioned- the Ministry of Justice
                      managed the Commission’s funds. These financial statements were submitted for
                      audit to the Kenya National Audit Office (Auditor-General), in compliance with the
                      provisions of section 20 of the Public Audit Act.41
                      	    Year 2010-2011: the Auditor General was of the opinion that the financial
                            statements as submitted to the National Audit Office were a fair representation,
                            in all material respects, of the financial position of the Commission as at the
                            close of that year. However, the opinion was qualified as the Auditor-General
                            raised concerns in relation to specific issues which were subsequently
                            addressed by the Commission.
                      	    Year 2011-2012: As at the time of submission of this Report, the Office of
                            the Auditor General had not issued its report concerning the Commission’s
                            financial position for the year 2011-2012.

             Allegations of corruption and financial improprieties
             97.	     In July 2011, the Commission was accused of corruption and other financial
                      improprieties. Reports surfaced in the media alleging corruption within the
                      Commission. The media reports appeared to reference internal documentation

             41	 See Appendix 3 for the Audited Statement of Financial Position for the Years 2010-2011 and 2011-2012.

                                                                                        Vol u m e I   Chapter ONE




       of the Commission although sourced through other organisations. This prompted
       the Commission to undertake urgent internal investigations. It was found that
       the media reports were unfounded. The investigations were undertaken with the
       generous cooperation of an organisation in which the individual who released
       the false information worked. The Commission was dismayed to learn that the
       information was based on selective release of misleading information from within
       the Commission by individuals linked to Ambassador Kiplagat.

98.	   Near the end of 2011 and into early 2012, new stories of financial mismanagement at
       the Commission surfaced in the press again. These stories were based on a confidential
       management letter that had been sent to the Commission by its external auditor.
       The letter from the auditors was a typical management letter – written after an initial
       review of the Commission’s accounts and requesting clarification on a number of
       matters. As part of the auditing process, and not the end of it, management letters
       do not provide a reliable indication of the state of an organisation’s financial affairs.

99.	 Unfortunately copies of the management letter were leaked from inside the
     Commission to numerous media houses. Established media houses contacted
     the Commission and when the nature of the document they had been given was
     explained to them, they declined to publish the story. Some papers, however,
     did publish a series of stories alleging that the Commission’s auditors had found
     massive fraud and corruption within the Commission. In fact, the Commission had
     already responded to the management letter answering each of the queries raised
     by the auditors, which eventually resulted in an audit report that raised absolutely
     no concerns relating to financial mismanagement or improprieties, much less
     corruption. The Commission immediately posted the audit report on its website.

100.	 Even after the audit report was published on the Commission’s website, the Nairobi
      Law Monthly printed a story based on the misinformed media reports appearing
      several months earlier in segments of the alternative media commonly known as the
      gutter press. Even more disappointing was the fact that Nairobi Law Monthly did not
      contact the Commission for a comment, or try to verify its story. This was particularly
      unfortunate as the Nairobi Law Monthly went on to name specific Commissioners
      and staff members as having stolen money from the Commission. The ironic reality
      is that the Commissioners had in fact lent money to the Commission at a time when
      it had not received quarterly funding from the Treasury to enable the Commission
      to perform its core functions. Those who reported on the matter misread the
      financial documents given to them – or were relying upon the interpretation of
      those documents given by individuals who wanted to harm the reputation of the
      Commission. Thus, those Commissioners who were the most generous were the
      ones most unjustly vilified in publications such as the Nairobi Law Monthly.

             Operational Period
             101.	 In line with the TJRC Agreement, the TJR Act required the Commission to operate for
                   a period of two years,42 preceded by a three-month establishment phase.43

             102.	 The two-year operational period granted to the Commission was ambitious even
                   in the best of circumstances, considering the breadth and complexity of the
                   Commission’s mandate. The Commission’s material mandate was by far the broadest
                   of any truth commission ever established, encompassing inquiry into violations of
                   civil and political rights as well as socio-economic rights. Its temporal mandate was
                   similarly wide, spanning 12 December 1963 to 28 February 2008, a period of just less
                   than 45 years.

             103.	 Beyond the magnitude of the task the Commission faced several challenges and
                   difficulties that had the effect of hampering its work and slowing implementation
                   of its mandate. In particular, the Commission lost considerable time and
                   credibility at the beginning of its term due to the controversy that surrounded the
                   suitability of its Chairperson which lasted fifteen months from the appointment
                   of the Commissioners in August 2009, to the stepping aside of the Chairperson in
                   November 2010. The Commission also suffered financial and resource constraints
                   that stalled its operations for the better part of its first year of operations. As a result,
                   the Commission was not able to begin operating substantively and effectively until
                   September 2010, a full year after its establishment.

             The first extension (November 2011 to May 2012)
             104.	 As the end of the operational period approached, the Commission assessed the
                   progress it had made in executing its mandate and the outstanding workload viz
                   à vis its capacity. The Commission concluded that it would be unable to finalise
                   its work within the two years statutory limit. By June 2011 the Commission had
                   conducted hearings in North Eastern Province and partially in Western Province.
                   With six (6) provinces to go and a series of other mandate operations that had not
                   been executed, the Commission reached the considered opinion that it would not
                   finalise its work within the remaining three months.

             105.	 Thus, on 24 June 2011, pursuant to section 20(3) of the TJR Act, the Commission
                   requested the National Assembly to extend its tenure for a period of six months
                   as expressly provided for by the Act. The National Assembly did not consider this
                   request until two months later, on 18 August 2011, whereupon it voted to extend the
                   Commission’s term as requested.

                                                                                     Vol u m e I   Chapter ONE




The second extension (May to August 2012)
106.	 Despite the fact that the Commission had been granted an extension, the outstanding
      workload remained enormous and demanding. Although it adhered to a compact
      timetable, the Commission concluded hearings in April 2012 having conducted
      220 well attended hearing sessions during which more than 680 individuals
      testified before the Commission. In March 2012 when the Commission concluded
      its individual hearings, it had less than a month to finalise and submit its report.
      This proved to be an impossible task. The one month period was only sufficient to
      process transcripts of hearings that the Commission had conducted in January and
      February 2012, leaving the key task of report writing undone.

107.	 Faced with this challenge, the Commission requested that the three-month
      statutory winding up period provided to the Commission (3 May to 3 August 2012)
      be reallocated to its operational period to give the Commission an additional
      three months to work on the report. Under the circumstances obtaining then, this
      was the best request that the Commission could make. To effect the request an
      amendment to the TJR Act had to be made.

108.	 While the Commission expressed its request towards the end of April, it was only on
      7 August 2012 that Parliament considered and approved the request. By that time,
      the relevant period over which an extension had been sought had already lapsed.

109.	 In essence, the Commission operated in legal limbo for three months as it waited
      for Parliament to consider its request. Although the Commission continued to
      write its report during this period, the uncertainty over its legal status impacted
      negatively on its operations. Firstly, the Commission could neither conduct certain
      mandate operations (such as notifying adversely mentioned persons of their right
      to respond to allegations levelled against them) nor incur expenditures on mandate
      related operations. Secondly, the Commission suffered high turn-over of staff during
      this period. As a result, its capacity to operate at an optimal level was significantly
      reduced, especially as it had a lean staff complement to begin with.

The third extension (August 2012 to May 2013)
110.	 With a second extension, the Commission was expected to deliver its report on 3
      August 2012. However, as it has been indicated above, Parliament did not consider
      the Commission’s request for an extension until 7 August 2012. This was mainly due
      to the fact that the Commission was compelled to review its position on passing on
      various aspects of its mandate to the implementation mechanism to be established
      at the end of the life of the Commission.

111.	 For the above reason, the Commission once again requested an extension of
      tenure to enable it finalise its report. On 27 November 2012, the National Assembly
      unanimously voted to extend the Commission’s operational period to 3 May 2013.

                  Interpretation of Mandate


Introduction
1.	   This Chapter presents the Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission’s (the
      Commission) understanding of its overriding objectives and interpretation of its
      mandate, both material and temporal. The Commission adopted a purposive and
      liberal interpretation of its objectives and functions; an approach that accorded
      with established principles and rules of international human rights law and best
      practices in the field of transitional justice.

2.	   In interpreting its mandate, the Commission took into account relevant official
      documents that preceded and informed its establishment. These documents include:

      	   Report of the Task Force on the Establishment of a Truth, Justice and Reconciliation
           Commission, 2003;

      	   General Principles and Parameters for the Truth, Justice and Reconciliation
           Commission (TJRC Agreement);

      	   Memorandum of Objects and Reasons (attached to the Truth, Justice and
           Reconciliation Bill, 2008);

      	   Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Act No. 6 of 2008 (TJR Act); and
      	   Parliamentary Hansard reports relating to the enactment of the TJR Act.

Volume I   Chapter TWO




             3.	     The Commission also benefitted immensely from the experiences of other
                     truth commissions and the writings of scholars and practitioners. Moreover, the
                     Commission drew inspiration from United Nations’ work in transitional justice. In
                     particular, the Commission used the following UN documents as interpretative
                     guides: Report of the Secretary-General on the Rule of Law and Transitional
                     Justice in Conflict and Post-Conflict Societies;1 Set of Principles for the Protection
                     and Promotion of Human Rights through Action to Combat Impunity;2 Basic
                     Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy and Reparation for Victims
                     of Gross Violations of International Human Rights Law and Serious Violations of
                     International Humanitarian Law;3 and the Report of the Special Rapporteur on the
                     Promotion and Truth, Justice, Reparation and Guarantees on Non-Recurrence.4

             4.	     This Chapter is structured as follows: The second section after this introduction
                     explains how the Commission understood the core concepts that were central to
                     its mandate and operations. These concepts are truth, justice and reconciliation.
                     The third section explores the scope of the Commission’s objectives and functions.
                     The fourth and fifth sections deal respectively with the Commission’s temporal and
                     subject matter mandate. The final three sections address the following themes:
                     breadth and complexity of the mandate; responsibility for violations and injustices;
                     and other relevant aspects of the Commission’s mandate.

40           REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION
                                                                                     Vol u m e I   Chapter TWO




Core Concepts
Truth

5.	   The right to truth is now an established right in international human rights law.
      Indeed, there is a burgeoning jurisprudence and literature recognising and
      affirming the right of victims of gross violations of human rights to know and be
      informed of the truth. However, what constitutes the truth in a particular context
      and society is often subject to contestations and multiple conflicting narratives.
      Thus, the role of a truth commission in this regard is to ‘set the record straight’.
      That it was envisaged that the Commission would play such a role is evident from
      its title.

6.	   However, apart from its title, the TJR Act does not make reference to the term ‘truth’.
      As such, the mandate of the Commission in relation to establishing the truth is
      drawn from the spirit and totality of the Act and in particular, from the provisions
      of sections 5(a) and (b) of the Act.

7.	   Although section 5(a) and (b) does not make reference to the term ‘truth’, it was
      understood that the provisions thereof conferred on the Commission the obligation
      to establish the truth relating to gross violations of human rights and historical
      injustices in Kenya. Section 5(a) provides that the Commission’s mandate includes
      ‘establishing an accurate, complete and historical record of violations and abuses
      of human rights and economic rights during the mandate period. Section 5(b), on
      the other hand, states that the mandate of the Commission includes ‘establishing
      as complete a picture as possible of the causes, nature and extent of the gross
      violations of human rights and economic rights.

8.	   By requiring the Commission to establish a complete historical record of violations
      and abuses committed within a 45-year period, section 5(a) imposed on the
      Commission an ambitious and almost insurmountable task. Section 5(b) took a
      more permissive language as it required the Commission to establish ‘as complete
      a picture as possible’. In essence, section 5(b) implicitly recognised that establishing
      a complete picture of the causes, nature and extent of violations could not be
      practically achieved. On the whole, however, given the fact that the Commission
      was a temporary body with limited resources, the contents of this Report are not
      exhaustive in terms of establishing a complete record of gross violations of human
      rights or painting a complete picture of the causes, nature and extent of these
      violations.

Volume I   Chapter TWO




             9.	      In addition to its institutional limitations, there are myriad other factors that
                      worked against the Commission’s efforts to come close to satisfying the demands
                      of section 5(a) and (b). Some of the events that the Commission was required to
                      investigate or constituted antecedents to those events, happened many decades
                      ago. As such, victims had already died and relevant evidence was no longer available
                      or accessible. Even where some victims were still alive, their memory was hazy.
                      Although the Commission received more than 40 000 statements and memoranda
                      from individual victims and communities, it could not feasibly investigate each and
                      every of these cases. As such, it relied on windows cases and statistical patterns
                      to reach its conclusions on the extent of violations during the mandate period.5
                      Moreover, like any other truth commission, the Commission relied on the self will
                      of individuals to present their cases to it. As indicated below, the Commission is
                      aware that many victims of violations and injustices did not present their cases to
                      the Commission.

             10.	     The challenge the Commission faced in establishing a complete record and picture
                      of gross violations committed in Kenya from 1963 to 2008 is not unique. Many
                      truth commissions have had to contend with the fact that they cannot practically
                      establish complete records of human rights violations that have occurred within
                      their respective societies. For instance, the Sierra Leone Truth and Reconciliation
                      Commission observed as follows in relation to its mandate:
                          Given the resources available to the Commission, in terms of professional researchers
                          and investigators, not to mention its very short lifespan, Parliament was surely ambitious
                          in thinking that the Commission could create anything resembling a comprehensive
                          historical record of the conflict in Sierra Leone.6

             11.	     That truth commissions are practically unable to and should not be expected to
                      produce a complete document of violations and abuses is also acknowledged
                      by scholars. According to Hayner, a leading transitional justice scholar, ‘[it] is
                      impossible for any short-term commission to fully detail the extent and effect of
                      widespread abuses that took place over many years, or, for most, to investigate
                      every single case brought to it’.7

             12.	     Against this backdrop, what this report contains is the truth as it was presented
                      to the Commission through the various ways discussed in the next chapter. By
                      using the stories that it received and through its research and investigations, the
                      Commission has been able to irrefutably establish that certain events that resulted

42           REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION
                                                                                     Vol u m e I   Chapter TWO




       in gross violations of human rights and injustices to individuals and communities
       did in fact take place. Therefore, the reality and occurrence of these events cannot
       and should not be denied any more, at least in official circles and by the state.

13.	   In finding the truth, the Commission was not just interested in what happened. Many
       (though not all) of the violations within its mandate had already been documented
       quite extensively by other institutions and individuals. Rather the Commission was
       particularly interested in why things happened the way they did, what was their
       impact and who was responsible. The Commission also wanted to contribute to the
       narrative truth of these violations, providing an opportunity for Kenyans to share
       and hear their individual and collective experiences of such violations.

14.	   In the debates that preceded the creation of the Commission and indeed for
       the larger part of its tenure, critics argued that everyone knows the truth about
       historical injustices and violations. Some wondered whether it was at all important
       to invest both time and resources in establishing what they considered to be
       matters of public knowledge. While the Commission can see that there is some
       basis for this position, ultimately the value of the Commission and its work goes
       far beyond what is currently in the public record. In the first place there is much of
       Kenya’s past that is not a matter of public knowledge. The Commission was tasked
       with investigating matters buried deep in Kenya’s history and providing answers
       to numerous questions. Secondly, some of what was considered public knowledge
       was often based on rumour, innuendo and bias. It was an important mission of the
       Commission to separate fact from fiction and to debunk myths.

15.	   In so doing, the Commission hoped to contribute to building a new social truth and
       shared understanding of the past for all Kenyans. A truth that not only a narrated
       key events of Kenya’s past, but a truth that identified the underlying fault lines that
       serve to explain why it has been that Kenyans have turned on Kenyans repeatedly
       in the past, most recently and significantly after the 2007 General Election. It is
       the Commission’s fervent hope that the truth established herein will assist in the
       establishment of a re-energised and united Kenya in which the violations and
       injustices relayed in the chapters of this report will never happen again.

16.	   The stories related in this Report are largely the stories of ordinary Kenyans. Over 40
       000 Kenyans shared their stories of violations and injustices with the Commission. Like
       most truth commissions, however, the Commission did not receive many statements
       or much cooperation from high ranking public officers, politicians and government
       officials. The Commission approached a number of such high-profile individuals who
       have held numerous positions of responsibility in the past (and many of whom still

Volume I   Chapter TWO




                      hold positions of responsibility). With a few notable exceptions, most declined to file
                      statements with or otherwise provide information to the Commission.

             17.	     Moreover, many ordinary citizens did not file statements with the Commission.
                      Thus, the Commission is acutely aware that for every statement it received and
                      every story it heard, many more statements and stories, in their thousands, remain
                      unwritten and unheard. The Commission tried to reach out to victims and witnesses
                      in all parts of Kenya. Their stories are reflective of the array of experiences and the
                      suffering of victims across the land.

             Justice
             18.	     The concept of justice in the context of transitional justice has been defined as:
                          […] an ideal of accountability and fairness in the protection and vindication of rights
                          and the prevention and punishment of wrongs. Justice implies regard for the rights of
                          the accused, for the interests of victims and for the well-being of society at large. It
                          is a concept rooted in all national cultures and traditions and, while its administration
                          usually implies formal judicial mechanisms, traditional dispute resolution mechanisms
                          are equally relevant.8

             19.	     ‘Formal judicial mechanisms’ usually refers to a criminal justice system that results in
                      the punishment of those found responsible for offences. Such systems of retributive
                      justice focus on individual criminal responsibility and on forms of punishment that
                      are proportional to the wrongs committed.

             20.	     Truth commissions have traditionally been viewed as providing an alternative to
                      the more traditional retribution-based view of justice. They are one of a number of
                      institutional innovations that further restorative rather than retributive justice. The
                      Commission followed in the footsteps of many of its international predecessors
                      in emphasizing an approach to justice that weighs more towards restorative than
                      retributive justice. Some of these previous truth commissions have been criticised
                      as for foregoing completely foregoing any element of retributive justice. While such
                      commissions furthered restorative justice, the absence of any retributive elements
                      often led individuals within the countries within which such commissions operated
                      to complain that ‘justice’ had not been. While the Commission adopted a notion of
                      justice that encompasses more than its retributive elements such as punishment,
                      it also recognises the important role that retributive criminal justice systems can
                      have in furthering not only justice, but also truth and reconciliation.

21.	    The drafters of the TJR Act were sensitive to the criticisms aimed at previous
        truth commissions concerning their perceived lack of focus on justice and thus
        made sure to both include the word ‘justice’ in the title of the Commission as well
        as to empower the Commission to further justice by engaging with the more
        traditionally retributive criminal justice system. Most importantly, the Commission
        was empowered by the Act to ‘identify any persons who should be prosecuted for
        being responsible or involved in human rights and economic rights violations and
        abuses’.9

                                                                                                               To tell you

        work and in this Report. Retributive justice mechanisms, because of their focus
        on perpetrators and punishment, are often ill-equipped to cater to the needs
        of victims. While restorative justice does not preclude accountability and even
        punishment for perpetrators, it is equally focused on repairing the harm done to
        victims and the greater community. Recognising and acknowledging the suffering
        and experiences of victims and searching for ways to move forward as a nation, are
        crucial to restorative justice. Social justice, on the other hand, is linked to equality
        and respect for human rights. Social justice
            generally refers to the idea of creating a society or institution that is based on the
            principles of equality and solidarity, that understands and values human rights, and that
            recognises the dignity of every human being […] Social justice is based on the idea of a
            society which gives individuals and groups fair treatment and a just share of the benefits
            of society.10

                                    REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION                     45

             25.	     Some aspects of the Commission’s mandate inevitably required the Commission to
                      adopt restorative and social conceptions of justice. In particular, the TJR Act required
                      the Commission to determine ways and means of redress for victims of gross
                      violations of human rights.11 More specifically, section 42 of the TJR Act provided
                      for the procedure for recommending reparation and rehabilitation of victims of
                      gross violations of human rights. Moreover, in assessing and recommending ways
                      of redressing violations of socio-economic rights and the legacy of economic
                      marginalisation in respect to certain regions or communities, the Commission
                      adopted a restorative and social conception of justice.

             Reconciliation
             26.	     Reconciliation is a complex concept. As the South African Truth and Reconciliation
                      Commission learnt in its work, reconciliation is not only a highly contested concept,
                      but it also has no simple definition.12 As such, it was satisfied, justifiably so, with
                      outlining the essential elements of reconciliation rather than defining the term.
                      The elements it identified include that: reconciliation is both a goal and a process;
                      it is experienced at different levels (intra-personal, inter-personal, community and
                      national); and that reconciliation has linkages to redistribution in terms of material
                      reconstruction and the restoration of dignity. Similarly, the Sierra Leone Truth and
                      Reconciliation Commission conducted its reconciliation work on the premise that
                      ‘there is no universal model of reconciliation that can apply to all countries’.13

             27.	     The Commission took a similar approach which it spelt out in its Reconciliation
                      Policy and which is discussed in detail in the chapter on National Unity, Healing
                      and Reconciliation in this Report.

             28.	     In essence, the Commission understood reconciliation to be a process rather than
                      an event. It is a process undertaken by individuals who have committed or suffered
                      violations and as such can be intensely private and personal. It is also a process
                      that can be encouraged and even undertaken at the community and national
                      level. Thus, the Commission saw its role in relation to reconciliation as that of
                      laying the foundation for a long-term process. This approach finds validity when
                      one considers the products of the KNDR negotiations.

             29.	     The KNDR team wisely laid the foundation for the creation of two institutions to
                      further reconciliation: this temporary Commission and the permanent National
                      Cohesion and Integration Commission (NCIC). Entrusting reconciliation in a

                                                                                              Vol u m e I   Chapter TWO




        permanent commission dedicated to national cohesion acknowledges that
        reconciliation is not only a process, but a continuous process. Reconciliation, like
        freedom, democracy, national unity and many other fundamental values to which
        modern Kenya aspires, must always be nurtured and cared for. This Commission,
        therefore, does not claim to have achieved reconciliation for the nation. Rather,
        the hope of the Commission is that by uncovering the truth, providing a forum for
        individuals to share their experiences and by providing some accountability, the
        Commission will have placed the nation on a path to further reconciliation and
        national cohesion and unity.

30.	    While the Commission could not in its short lifespan reconcile the nation, its hearings
        provided the opportunity for many to commence a healing process. Many victims
        appreciated the opportunity to relate their stories to an official body that would
        record and acknowledge their experiences and suffering. Many victims expressed
        relief after publicly sharing their stories and experiences. For such witnesses, public
        testimony was part of their own personal healing process and provided some
        assistance as they attempt to bring closure to the bitterness of the past.

31.	    For the vast majority of witnesses whose rights had been violated, the oral
        testimony they gave before the Commission marked the first time they had spoken
        publicly about their pain and suffering. Many individuals said the Commission was
        the first public agency to show concern for their situation. In this regard, a witness
        of the Malka Mari Massacre said:
            I never thought this Commission or anybody would ask about what happened to me. If I
            knew anybody would want to know the truth, I would have come forward [much earlier].14

32.	    A survivor of the security operation that became the Wagalla Massacre had similar
        sentiments:
            If you [the Commission] are taking statements, I have written ten statements before but
            nobody did anything for me. This is the first time I have been told to talk openly about it
            and I thank you very much for that.15

33.	    Another witness observed as follows when he was asked about his expectations
        following his testimony before the Commission:
            To tell you the truth, I do not have any expectations. Talking about it, praise to God, is
            good enough. I never thought I would see a Commission looking for the truth.16

             34.	    For others, the platform the Commission provided for a public narration of violations
                     they had suffered contributed to lessening the social stigma associated with their
                     violations. As an example, Omar Qutara, whose story is told in detail elsewhere in this
                     report, was arrested in 1982, detained, tortured and later sentenced to three years
                     imprisonment for allegedly participating in the 1982 attempted coup. For close to
                     30 years following his release from prison, he lived with the shame of being referred
                     to as a ‘rebel’ or ‘fugitive’. His children also suffered stigma. His eloquent and detailed
                     testimony before the Commission was the first time that he had publicly spoken
                     about his experience and in conclusion, he was grateful for that opportunity. He said:
                         I can sleep today. I am a little relieved. That was the major problem. I wanted many
                         people to come here because many of them call us fugitives or rebels here in town. I am
                         sure they have heard it today with their own ears.17

             35.	    While the hearings had a therapeutic effect for individuals like Omar Qutara, it
                     was not so for some who testified before the Commission. Even as it conducted
                     its hearings, the Commission sufficiently warned itself of the potential of hearings
                     or truth-telling to re-traumatise victims. Such was the experience of a victim who
                     testified before the Commission in Kapenguria:
                         When I think about those issues, I feel so bad. I do not see the reason why we should talk
                         over such issues, because it will not help me. I do not have any children; one of my ears
                         cannot hear; I do not have any property; my son, who was a man, died because there
                         was nobody who could take care of him when he was sick. I failed to get another person,
                         a man, who will inherit my wealth. Even if I talk from here, I do not know whether the
                         government can really help somebody. What is the importance of all these discussions as
                         we sit here?18

             36.	    To mitigate the effects of re-traumatisation, the Commission instituted a number
                     of support mechanisms for victims and other witnesses who testified before it.

             Inter-relationships between truth, justice and reconciliation
             37.	    Truth, justice and reconciliation – the three pillars of the Commission – share a complex
                     relationship. Depending on how they are pursued, they can both complement
                     and reinforce each other, or be in tension with and even conflict with each other.
                     Truth is necessary for furthering justice and reconciliation; justice is necessary for
                     reconciliation; and reconciliation may be necessary for truth and for justice.

             38.	    From inception, the Commission proceeded from the premise that the three values
                     of truth, justice and reconciliation are mutually inclusive and that they complement

         each other. None of the values should be seen or pursued in isolation. This is an
         approach that has been recently advocated by the UN Special Rapporteur on the
         Promotion of Truth, Justice, Reparation and Guarantees of Non-recurrence. In
         his first report to the UN Human Rights Council, in which he made a case for a
         comprehensive approach to the constituent elements of his mandate he noted:
             The Special Rapporteur takes the four components of the mandate, truth, justice,
             reparations and guarantees of non-recurrence as a set of measures that are related to,
             and can reinforce, one another, when implemented to redress the legacies of massive
             human rights violations and abuses. Redressing the legacies of abuse means primarily
             giving force to those human rights norms that were systematically or grossly violated
             […] While arguably, they all serve the ultimate end of pursuing justice, a less abstract
             functional analysis that distinguishes between the immediate, mediate and final ends of
             the measures would say that the four measures can be conceptualized as assisting in the
             pursuit of two mediate goals, i.e., providing recognition to victims and fostering trust, and
             two final goals, i.e. contributing to reconciliation and strengthening the rule of law.19

39.	     In the paragraphs that follow, the Commission explains how it conceptualised the
         linkages and inter-relationships between truth, justice and reconciliation.

Truth and justice
40.	     Former UN Special Rapporteur Louis Joinet refers to the ‘inalienable right to truth’,
         which he defines as a ‘collective right, drawing upon history, to prevent violations
         from recurring’.20 Justice thus looks to the past to facilitate a better future by holding
         individuals to account for the wrongs they committed; by providing reparations to
         those who suffered violations; and, through an acknowledgment of such violations
         and an understanding of their causes, providing guidance to the present generation
         to prevent the commission of such violations upon future generations.

41.	     In essence, truth telling is necessary for justice. By identifying those individuals and
         institutions responsible for historical violations, truth telling contributes to holding
         those responsible to account through public naming and shaming and provides
         evidence to support the Commission’s obligation to recommend to the government
         those individuals who should be investigated and, if sufficient evidence exists,
         prosecuted. Such truth telling also provides a basis for other recommendations,
         including those relating to individuals or institutions that should contribute to
         reparation initiatives and those individuals who should be barred from public office
         or other positions of responsibility and trust.

Volume I   Chapter TWO




             Truth and reconciliation
             42.	     The relationship between truth and reconciliation is twofold. First, public truth-
                      telling offers a forum for the victims to recount publicly their experiences and to
                      have such experiences acknowledged. Such acknowledgement can contribute to
                      individual healing and thus strengthen the courage of victims and perpetrators to
                      work in furtherance of reconciliation and national unity. As expressed by the Sierra
                      Leone Truth and Reconciliation Commission, reconciliation must be based on an
                      understanding of the past ‘which allows both victims and perpetrators to find the
                      space to live side by side in a spirit of tolerance and respect’.21 This concept is also
                      expressed in the mandate of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada, ‘[t]
                      he truth of our common experiences will help set our spirits free and pave the way to
                      reconciliation’.22

             43.	 Second, truth-telling offers an opportunity to uncover historical truths and
                  interrogate the past. Periods of transition offer a unique opportunity to redraft
                  social understandings of a country’s history and rectify past narratives imposed
                  by the state in furtherance of the interests of a powerful few or an intolerant
                  majority. A member of the Chile Truth and Reconciliation Commission expressed
                  the relationship between truth telling and reconciliation thus:
                          Society cannot simply block out a chapter of its history; it cannot deny the facts of its
                          past, however differently these may be interpreted. Inevitably the void would be filled
                          with lies or with conflicting, confusing versions of the past. A nation’s unity depends on
                          a shared identity, which in turn depends largely on a shared memory.23

             44.	     This is not to say that all Kenyans need to agree on a new historical account; rather,
                      the Commission aims to generate constructive debate and discussion by bringing
                      to light information and facts that were previously unknown or little known to
                      Kenyans. Reconciliation, like history, is the result of a process of engagement with
                      the past by the present in order to secure a more just and peaceful future.

             Justice and reconciliation
             45.	     There can be little doubt that effective and prompt justice will promote meaningful
                      reconciliation. Justice initiatives have the potential to foster reconciliation. In particular,
                      the following could promote reconciliation: providing adequate reparations to victims,
                      whether individual or communal; acknowledging those who suffered wrongs and
                      those individuals and institutions responsible; investigating and, where appropriate,

50           REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION
                                                                                       Vol u m e I   Chapter TWO




       prosecuting those responsible; reforming institutions to prevent future violations
       and to provide equal opportunity and support to all Kenyans, including those from
       historically marginalized communities.

46.	   The justice furthered by the Commission is restorative in focus and thus joins easily
       with efforts to further reconciliation. While restorative justice does not preclude
       retributive justice, it would be a mistake to focus on the retributive contributions
       or omissions of the Commission and its work in evaluating its contribution to
       reconciliation. For, while retributive justice can and has contributed to reconciliation,
       it may also undercut reconciliation.

47.	   In developing its recommendations for further investigations, prosecutions and
       other forms of retributive justice, the Commission was sensitive to the needs of
       reconciliation and national unity. There is no doubt that some will question the
       choices made by the Commission in this regard, arguing that some who have been
       recommended for prosecution should not have been so recommended, or that
       others should be enjoined together with those who have been recommended
       for prosecution. This does not mean however that there can be no meaningful
       reconciliation at the individual, community and national levels. There is much that
       can be done to foster reconciliation between individuals and groups. These important
       tasks should not simply be left in the hands of investigators, lawyers, prosecutors
       and technocrats. It is the responsibility of all Kenyans to pursue reconciliation.




                              REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION                     51
Volume I   Chapter TWO




             Objectives and Functions of the Commission
             48.	   The objectives and functions of the Commission were respectively spelt out in
                    sections 5 and 6 of the TJR Act. Although these objectives and functions were
                    outlined in two separate sections of the Act, the Commission proceeded with its
                    work with the understanding that both sections essentially related to its mandate
                    and there were no strict distinctions between its objectives, on the one hand and
                    its functions, on the other.

             49.	   Section 5 of the TJR Act provides that ‘the objectives of the Commission shall be to
                    promote peace, justice, national unity, healing and reconciliation among the people
                    of Kenya’. These objectives must be understood from a historical perspective, and
                    particularly, in relation to both historical and immediate reasons leading to the
                    formation of the Commission. Chapter one of this Report recounted that history,
                    but it must be emphasised here that central to establishing the Commission was
                    the stark and painful realisation that Kenya’s past and history could no longer be
                    ignored or ‘swept under the carpet’. The past had to be confronted.

             50.	   Thus, when the Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Bill, 2008 (TJR Bill) was introduced
                    in Parliament for debate, the Minister for Justice stated in her ‘Memorandum of
                    Objects and Reasons’ that:
                         […] The Bill is borne of the realisation that lasting peace and co-existence cannot prevail
                         in Kenya unless historical injustices and violation and abuse of human rights have been
                         addressed.

             51.	   The Minister further explained that:

                         The Bill emanates from the deliberations of the National Dialogue and Reconciliation
                         Committee which was formed after a political crisis ensued following a dispute on the
                         outcome of the Presidential Election held on 27th December, 2007. The political crisis
                         brought to the surface deep-seated and long-standing divisions within the Kenyan
                         society and to heal those divisions, a raft of constitutional, legal and political measures
                         to defuse the crisis were proposed, among them being the formation of a Commission
                         to deal with historical injustices and violation of human rights. The establishment of the
                         Commission was conceived with a view to addressing historical problems and injustices
                         which, if left unaddressed, threatened the very existence of Kenya as a modern society.

             52.	   The fact that the past had to be confronted was eminently clear to the National
                    Assembly when it sat to debate the TJR Bill. In seconding that the Bill be read a
                    second time, a member of the KNDR team indicated that:

                                                                                                       Vol u m e I   Chapter TWO




             […] the events of the last General Election taught this country a lot of painful lessons. It
             has given us a chance to reflect on our past. It has become absolutely necessary to bring
             our past to some closure so that we can move ahead as a country. The Truth, Justice and
             Reconciliation Commission is the avenue through which Kenyans from all walks of life,
             and with truth, justice and reconciliation being their mission, come together to express
             themselves in this exercise so that they can bring their past to a closure and open a new
             chapter for us to move ahead as a country. It became clear that among the things that
             informed the near destruction of our country in the last General Election were issues
             that have been pending for a long time. There were historical injustices and prejudices
             that were informed by past events, deeds and actions by individuals, organisations and
             governments. It is necessary for us to bring that to a closure so that Kenya can exit from
             these prejudices and perceived or real injustices that were meted to the people of Kenya,
             thereby causing the mistrust that exists between our citizenry. The Bible says ‘if you know
             the truth, the truth will set you free’. It is important for us to get to know the truth so that, as
             a country, we become free. It is important for the things that have been said about people
             and communities be known. The truth about government bodies, individuals and public
             officers must be known. The truth must be known so that we can set our country free. It is
             said that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. It is, therefore, important for
             us, as a country, to deal with injustices that have been meted upon citizens of our country,
             whether they are perceived or real so that again we can live in a just society.24

53.	     In addition to stating the objectives of the Commission, section 5 also indicated 10
         ways by which those objectives should be achieved. When these modes of achieving
         its objectives were read together with section 6 of the Act, the Commission found
         it necessary to conceptually cluster its functions into four broad categories, that
         is, functions relating to: creating a historical record; victims, perpetrators; and the
         report.

On a historical record
54.	     Although the TJR Act does not create a hierarchy in relation to the functions of
         the Commission, it is noteworthy that the first two ways in which it envisaged
         that the Commission would execute its objectives is through the compiling of a
         historical record. In this regard, section 5(a) mandated the Commission to establish
         an accurate, complete and historical record of gross violations of human rights
         committed in Kenya by various state actors between 12 December 1963 and 28
         February 2008. Section 5(b) mandated the Commission to establish as complete a
         picture as possible of the causes, nature and extent of violations of human rights. In
         this regard, the catalogue of specific violations that the Commission investigated is
         provided and discussed in detail further below.

Volume I   Chapter TWO




             On victims
             55.	     Victims are at the heart of a truth-telling process and the operations of a truth
                      commission. The process ought to give agency and recognition to victims.
                      Ultimately, it should provide redress to victims. The process itself should be
                      sensitive and humane.

             56.	     According to the UN Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy
                      and Reparation for Victims, ‘victims should be treated with humanity and respect
                      for their dignity and human rights and appropriate measures should be taken to
                      ensure their safety, physical and psychological well-being and privacy, as well as
                      those of their families’.25 In this light and in keeping with international standards,
                      sections 5 and 6 of the TJR Act mandated the Commission to carry out the following
                      functions with respect to victims:

                      	    Identify and specify victims of violations;26

                      	    Determine ways and means of redressing the suffering of victims;27

                      	    Provide victims with a platform for non-retributive truth telling;28
                      	    Provide victims with a forum to be heard and restore their dignity;29

54           REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION
                                                                                            Vol u m e I   Chapter TWO




          	     Investigate into the whereabouts of victims and restore their dignity;30 and
          	     Recommend reparation measures in respect of victims.31

57.	 The Commissions faithfully performed these functions. On identifying and
     specifying victims of violations, the Commission has compiled and published in this
     Report a list of victims of various violations committed during its mandate period.
     The list contains the names of victims who submitted their cases to the Commission
     and as such, it is not a complete list of all people who suffered violations during
     the mandate period. In relation to determining ways and means of redressing the
     suffering of victims, this report contains a catalogue of recommendations aimed
     at repairing the harm suffered by victims. The Commission’s measures intended to
     ensure that victims have a platform for non-retributive truth-telling are discussed
     in detail in the next chapter.

58.	      In a nutshell, the Commission held various forms of hearings which provided
          victims with the opportunity to narrate their stories and in the process restore their
          dignity and commence a healing process.

On perpetrators
59.	      While victims are at the heart of a truth-telling process, the involvement of alleged
          or actual perpetrators is equally important for optimum success of the process.
          Firstly, for a complete and accurate story of violations, the perspectives of both
          victims and perpetrators are a requisite. For this reason, section 5(a) of the TJR
          Act required the Commission to record the ‘motives and perspectives of the
          persons responsible for commission of the violations’. Secondly, inter-personal
          reconciliation between a victim and a perpetrator is by necessity dependent on the
          participation of both parties. Of course, a victim may reconcile with his situation
          and even forgive the perpetrator without the two ever meeting, but the benefits of
          a healing and reconciliation process are maximised when both parties have a joint
          forum for constructive engagement.

60.	      For these reasons, the TJR Act mandated the Commission to provide perpetrators
          with a platform for non-retributive truth telling and a forum to confess their actions
          as a way of bringing reconciliation.32 However, knowing that a careful balance
          must be struck between reconciliation and justice, the drafters of the TJR Act also
          recommended that the Commission should determine perpetrators of violations
          and where appropriate recommend their prosecution.33 The Act also mandated the

                            Commission to facilitate the granting of conditional amnesty to perpetrators who
                            make full disclosure of their involvement in violations. The Commission’s approach
                            in relation to this specific mandate relating to amnesty is discussed in detail later
                            in this chapter.

                     61.	 In respect to determining perpetrators of violations, the Commission has
                          published in this report names of individuals who were alleged to have
                          committed gross violations of human rights during its mandate period. The
                          Commission received allegations against 54,000 individuals. However, the list of
                          alleged perpetrators contained in this report is only limited to those who were
                          afforded an opportunity to respond to allegations levelled against them. Due
                          to limited resources and time constraints, the Commission could not notify all
                          alleged perpetrators of the nature of allegations raised against them. As such,
      the                 the Commission had to prioritise its work in relation to sending out notifications
 Commission               to alleged perpetrators. The criteria used included looking at the gravity of the

to narrate their            the Commission to do two main things in this report: document its findings and
                            make recommendations flowing from those findings. The Act stipulated that the
   stories and
                            recommendations of the Commission should include the following:
 in the process
  restore their              	   Recommendations for prosecution

  dignity and                	   Recommendations for reparation for victims

healing process.                  Commission’s findings

                                  implementation of its recommendations and an institutional arrangement.

                     63.	   Due to the numerous yet interrelated issues that it was called upon to document,
                            the Commission grappled with how best to structure this Report. Several options
                            were scrutinized and after lengthy discussions, the current structure was adopted.

                                                                                                            Vol u m e I   Chapter TWO




Temporal Mandate
64.	    The Commission’s temporal mandate was one of the least understood aspects
        of its mandate despite efforts by the Commission to educate the public on this
        subject. This situation arose because up until its formation, disagreements were
        still rife as to which period the Commission should cover in its inquiry. Before the
        Task Force on the Establishment of a TJRC, a considerable number of people were
        of the opinion that a Kenyan truth commission should have a temporal mandate
        dating back to 1895 when the boundaries of what is now Kenya were demarcated.
        In essence, there are those who wanted the envisaged commission to address
        violations and atrocities committed during the colonial period. The Task Force,
        while agreeing that the colonial period was marked by unspeakable atrocities,
        rejected the idea that a truth commission should inquire into issues dating as far
        back as 1895. The Task Force explained its position thus:
             First, that period (1895-1963) is too remote in time, and the questions that it raises are too
             complex for a transitional justice instrument like a truth commission. Evidence would be
             scant; many of the perpetrators are long dead or are in the United Kingdom. Secondly,
             the answerable power is not Kenya, but the United Kingdom, and truth commissions are
             not generally established to investigate a remote, departed power. Finally, extending the
             truth commission to the colonial period would be an impossibly expensive, laboriously
             prohibitive, and practically unmanageable exercise. For these reasons, the Task Force
             rejects 1895 as an impracticable time-line, and instead recommends that the Kenya
             government sets up a less ambitious vehicle, such as a committee of eminent Kenyans
             to examine a limited set of issues relating to the colonial period.34

65.	 For the colonial period, the Task Force recommended that ‘a less ambitious
     vehicle, such as a committee of eminent Kenyans’ be constituted for purposes
     of examining ‘a limited set of issues relating to the colonial period’. For the truth
     commission, the Task Force recommended that its temporal mandate be limited to
     the independence period. It offered four reasons for this position:
             The Task Force therefore is of the view that a truth commission ought to cover the period
             from 1963 to 2002, the post-colonial era and the period KANU ruled the country […]
             the reasons for this choice, which the Task Force endorses, are rational, compelling, and
             unassailable. First, the period combines the first and the second regimes under KANU,
             and as such cannot be said to be selective or directed at any particular community. This
             is important because a truth commission cannot be legitimate if it appears to be an
             instrument to settle scores against a particular former regime, community or individuals.
             Secondly, the post-colonial period is very present, and not remote. Many of those who

                         served in the independence government are still alive. Thirdly, it stands to reason that
                         Kenyans ought to rightly audit their own state, not the colonial British state. Fourth, the
                         human rights violations and gross economic crimes that the majority of Kenyans want
                         investigated were committed over the last forty years. Lastly, the investigation span of
                         the last forty years is financially feasible and defensible, practical, and could be carried
                         out within a two-year period. It is for these reasons that the Task Force recommends that
                         a truth commission cover the period from December 12, 1963 to December 31, 2002.35

             66.	    As described in the previous Chapter, the recommendations of the Task Force
                     were never followed through. However, when the question of establishing a
                     truth commission returned to the table under the KNDR process, the issue on the
                     temporal mandate of the commission returned with it too. Perhaps, acknowledging
                     that there were still some agitating for the colonial period to be the subject of
                     inquiry, parties to the TJRC Agreement decided to limit the commission’s mandate
                     to the independence period but they also agreed to give it room to look into events
                     prior to this period. According to the Agreement:
                         The Commission will inquire into such events which took place between December
                         12, 1963 and February 28, 2008. However, it will as necessary look at antecedents to
                         this date in order to understand the nature, root causes, or context that led to such
                         violations, violence or crimes.

             67.	    In terms of the TJRC Agreement, the TJR Bill delineated the Commission temporal
                     mandate to focus on the post-independence period, from 12 December 1963 when
                     Kenya got its independence to 28 February 2008 when the National Accord was
                     signed. But it also clearly indicated that the Commission would be empowered to
                     look into the colonial period in as far as this period was relevant for understanding
                     ‘antecedents, circumstances and context’of violations committed after independence.
                     When the Bill was introduced in Parliament, the Minister for Justice explained the
                     proposed temporal mandate of the Commission in the following words:
                         Clause 5 gives the objectives of the Commission as to promote peace, justice and
                         national unity, healing and reconciliation among the people of Kenya. The Commission
                         will, therefore, be establishing an accurate, complete and historical record of violation
                         and abuses of human rights and economic rights inflicted on Kenyans by the state,
                         public institutions and holders of public office, both serving and retired, between 12th
                         December, 1963 and 28th February, 2008.
                         These two dates are significant. 12th December 1963 is when we attained Independence
                         while 28th February 2008 is the date when the National Accord was signed. So, we want
                         to examine how we have dealt with each other as an independent state. However,
                         Clause 5A (i) recognises that we may need to go beyond 12th December 1963 to the

58           REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION
                                                                                                  Vol u m e I   Chapter TWO




             antecedents, circumstances and factors so as to contextualize such violations. If we
             need to go beyond 12th December 1963 to discover the genesis of the problem, the
             proposed Clause 5B does indicate that we can go as far back as possible in order to
             establish a complete picture of the causes, nature and extent of the gross violation of
             human and economic rights committed between the period I have stated and including
             antecedents and circumstances.36

68.	     Despite the above clear explanation, some members of Parliament still proceeded
         to lament that the proposed temporal mandate was too limiting to the extent that
         the colonial period was not covered. The words of Njeru Githae, then an Assistant
         Minister of Local government, are instructive in this regard:
             It is unfortunate that we have come up with the date of 12th December1963 when
             Kenya attained Independence. If I would have been asked, I would have said we need
             to go backwards to when Kenya as a nation we know today, first existed. I would have
             gone back to 1895. This is the time that some of the so-called historical injustices
             started. I have talked of the year 1895 because before then, Kenya, whether a colony or a
             protectorate did not exist. This then would have given Kenyans an opportunity to go as
             far back as memory can remember. This would give the basis for the so-called historical
             injustices. Some of the so-called historical injustices are actually a result of colonialism.37

69.	     After clarifications, those who harboured fears such as is quoted above came to
         understand that the envisaged commission could inquire into the colonial period.
         No changes were, therefore, made to the clauses in the TJR Bill relating to the
         temporal mandate of the Commission. Thus, in the TJR Act, the first part of the
         relevant sections mandates the Commission to investigate violations of human
         rights that occurred in Kenya between 12 December 1963 and 28 February 2008.38
         The second part mandates it to look into ‘antecedents, circumstances, factors
         and context’.39

70.	     Notwithstanding the clear authority, even obligation, in the Act to examine the
         pre-independence period for the root causes of the violations committed since
         independence, many Kenyans remained under the impression that the temporal
         mandate of the Commission strictly covered the period between 12 December 1963
         and 28 February 2008. For instance, in a letter to the Chairman of the Parliamentary
         Committee on Administration of Justice and Legal Affairs, the Release Political
         Prisoners Trust sought the review of the TJR Act because they claimed, amongst
         other reasons, that:

                          It ignores a crucial and critical part of the Kenyan history. It starts from 1963, yet some
                          of the root causes of the issues that date back to the colonial era are not covered in the
                          Act. Kenyans need to know why the period before independence is being left out of the
                          TJRC and why some Kenyans have been left out of the process, yet they have the living
                          testimonies and memories of the history and real life experiences; not allegations. To us,
                          the scope on the search for justice through TJRC should cover the history of our country
                          as a whole.

             71.	 The Kenya National Liberation War Veterans Association expressed similar
                  sentiments. In a submission to the Commission, the association lamented that:
                          The TJRC Act of 2008 excludes the colonial period. Hence our members ranging from
                          3,500 are being left out in the truth-telling process of our country; being left out of this
                          process leads to suffocation of Kenyan history and what haunt[s] us as a nation up to date.

             72.	 Indeed, similar concerns became one of the grounds of a suit seeking the
                  dissolution of the Commission. As discussed in detail in Chapter Four of this
                  Volume, the applicants in the case of Augustine Njeru Kathangu & 9 Others v TJRC
                  and Bethuel Kiplagat40 challenged the statutory mandate of the Commission,
                  arguing that the TJR Act was defective and unconstitutional to the extent that
                  it excluded the periods before 12 December 1963 and after 28 February 2008
                  from the Commission’s temporal mandate. The court dismissed the contention
                  on a technical ground, though in doing so it incorrectly accepted the underlying
                  assertion that the Commission was precluded from looking at events before or
                  after the prescribed temporal mandate:
                          We note that the ex parte applicants are concerned with human rights violations
                          which occurred prior to 12th December 1963 and after 28th February 2008, which are
                          not covered under the TJRC Act. It is arguable as to whether the legislature was right
                          in excluding those violations. This issue and other equally pertinent issues which
                          have been raised can only be determined in a properly pleaded case, preferably in a
                          constitutional reference.

             73.	 In addition to raising concerns about the perceived legal inability for the
                  Commission to inquire into events that occurred during the colonial period, some
                  people went further to assert that the Commission’s mandate should have been
                  extrapolated to cover the period after 28 February 2008. For instance, in its letter
                  already alluded to above, the Release Political Prisoners Trust argued that:
                          The [TJR] Act also ignores the period after February 2008, when other human rights
                          violations took place, especially the killing of human rights defenders GPO and Oscar

            King’ara of Oscar Foundation on March 5 2009 and the recent Mathira killings among
            other happenings that leave questionable marks on their intentions and purposes,
            alienating sections of Kenyans who keep on crying for justice.

74.	    This was an erroneous assumption. But first, it must be emphasised that being a
        temporary body, a truth commission must have a time-bound mandate. Its focus
        should be on past violations, as has been the case with all truth commissions across
        the world. The role of investigating ‘new’ and ‘current’ violations traditionally rests           the
        with permanent bodies such as the police department or national human rights                  Commission
        institutions. Occasionally, commissions of inquiry are constituted to investigate            was empowered
        particular current events or violations.                                                           to
75.	    With these caveats in mind, the Commission nevertheless proceeded with its work               look into the
        with the understanding that it could, in certain circumstances, inquire into events          colonial period
        that occurred after 28 February 2008. Firstly, borrowing mutatis mutandis from                 in as far as
        the ‘continuing violations’ doctrine developed by human rights treaty bodies, the            this period was
        Commission could extrapolate its mandate beyond 28 February 2008 if a violation
                                                                                                       relevant for
        under its inquiry was a continuing violation. That is, the violation commenced
        during the mandate period but continued after that period. For example, some of
                                                                                                     understanding
        the people displaced during the 2007-2008 Post-Election Violence remain in camps              ‘antecedents,
        and have not been compensated for their losses. As such, the Commission required             circumstances
        all individuals filling out a Statement Form to indicate whether the violation they
                                                                                                      and context’
        were recording was a continuing violation.41
                                                                                                      of violations
76.	    Secondly, the Commission was expressly mandated to ‘investigate any other                       committed
        matter that it considers requires investigations in order to promote and achieve                  after
        national reconciliation’.42 Therefore, notwithstanding that a violation or event             independence.
        occurred after its formal mandate, the Commission could investigate it, provided
        that such an investigation was necessary for the promotion and achievement of
        national reconciliation. Moreover, from a pragmatic point of view, it was important
        for the Commission to constantly take into account current developments which
        could impact on its work.

77.	    Despite the many concerns raised about its temporal mandate, when the Commission
        undertook its civic education campaigns and explained its mandate, many came to
        understand that the temporal mandate of the Commission was flexible and that
        its inquiry was a contextual one that required all events to be taken into account
        including those that had occurred prior to and after its formal mandate period.

Volume I   Chapter TWO




             Subject Matter Mandate
             78.	    Unlike most previous truth commissions, whose mandate focused on human rights
                     violations during a particular event (such as an armed conflict), the Commission’s
                     mandate covered a 45-year period of relative peace, albeit with occasional
                     eruptions of violence that were often limited to specific geographical areas or to
                     political transitions. In other words, the country as a whole has never experienced
                     an intense and long period of violence. However, the entire mandate period was
                     characterized by various forms of state violence and episodes of systematic and
                     widespread violations of human rights. The mandate period was also characterised
                     by state plunder, corruption and impunity.

             79.	    Against this background, it was important that the subject matter mandate of the
                     Commission be clearly spelt out. The question of what this Commission would
                     investigate was first dealt with by the Makau Mutua Task Force. According to
                     the Task Force, unlike the question relating to the temporal mandate, there was
                     substantively huge consensus among Kenyans on what violations and issues
                     should be the subject of a truth commission’s inquiry:
                         One of the least contested questions in the quest for a truth commission for Kenya
                         relates to its terms of reference or the matters that it must address, that is, the types
                         of violations that it must investigate. Although different communities, groups, and
                         individuals around the country expressed particular preferences to the Task Force, there
                         is no doubt about the functions that Kenyans want a truth commission to perform.
                         Kenyans want a truth commission to perform four inter-related functions. These are
                         establishing the truth about past atrocities by identifying the perpetrators and the
                         reasons behind their actions; recognising victims and providing justice or some form
                         of redress for the harm and suffering inflicted on them by the previous governments;
                         auditing the state and suggesting corrective measures to avoid a recurrence of abuses;
                         and creating an enabling environment for national reconciliation and healing.43

             80.	    The Task Force proceeded to observe that:
                         But Kenyans are clear that these functions cannot be successfully performed unless
                         established categories of human rights violations and economic crimes are fully
                         investigated and addressed. While it is true that many horrible and unimaginable
                         violations have been perpetrated by the state over the last forty years, the Task Force
                         believes that a truth commission cannot investigate every human rights violation. The
                         Task Force therefore recommends that a truth commission address certain categories
                         of violations. The violations that ought to form the terms of reference of a truth
                         commission must be those that indicate a systemic pattern or state policies, actions that

62           REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION
                                                                                               Vol u m e I   Chapter TWO




            were carried out as policies of the state to abrogate the rights of Kenyans. Thus a truth
            commission must have the discretion to decide which violations qualify for scrutiny.
            In any case, it is practically impossible for a truth commission to address more than
            several thousand cases. That is why the Task Force has identified individual cases and
            groups of violations that it believes ought to be the subject of inquiry. The Task Force
            has made this choice consistent with the views of Kenyans and with due regard to the
            purposes of an effective, timely, and the least burdensome truth commission. The Task
            Force recommends that a truth commission investigates six categories of human rights
            violations and economic crimes.

81.	    For these reasons the Task Force recommended that a Kenyan truth commission
        should limit its focus on the following six violations and/or issues:44
         	   Political assassinations and killings
         	   Massacres and possible genocides
         	   Political violence and killings of democracy advocates
         	   Torture, detention, exile, disappearances, rape, and persecution of opponents
         	   Politically instigated ethnic clashes
         	   Violations of economic, social and cultural rights

82.	    During the KNDR negotiations, this list was expanded to include numerous other
        issues and particularly, a category of issues falling under the rubric of historical
        injustices. In this regard, the TJRC Agreement states:
            The Commission will inquire into human rights violations, including those committed by
            the state, groups, or individuals. This includes but is not limited to politically motivated
            violence, assassinations, community displacements, settlements and evictions. The
            Commission will also inquire into major economic crimes, in particular grand corruption,
            historical land injustices, and the illegal and irregular acquisition of land, especially as
            these relate to conflict or violence. Other historical injustices shall be investigated.

83.	    The TJR Act was enacted with the recommendations of the Makau Mutua Task Force
        and the provisions of the TJRC Agreement in mind. However, sections 5 and 6 of the
        Act, under which the mandate of the Commission is spelt out, is at best ambiguous
        and confusing. For instance, it makes several incongruent references to the nature
        of rights to be investigated: ‘violations and abuses of human rights and economic
        rights’; ‘gross violations of human rights and economic rights’; and ‘gross human
        rights violations and violations of international human rights law and abuses’. In
        essence, it is not clear whether the drafters intended that the Commission focus on
44	 Makau Mutua Report (n 33 above) 30-33.




                                    REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION                       63
Volume I   Chapter TWO




                      ‘ordinary’ violations of human rights or on gross violations of human rights. Similarly,
                      multiple sections of the Act offer different prescriptions on the same topics. For
                      instance, on the subject of sexual violations, section 5(c) refers to ‘sexual violations’
                      but section 6(h) refers to ‘crime of a sexual nature against female victims’. Moreover,
                      while some key terms within the Commission’s mandate are defined, some are not
                      (such as ‘economic crime’). In addition, some definitions offered in the Act create
                      uncertainty and ambiguity concerning the intention of the drafters.

             84.	 Faced with these uncertainties and mindful of the high expectations many
                  placed on the Commission’s work, the Commission adopted a liberal approach to
                  interpreting its mandate. After a careful analysis of the provisions of the TJR Act, it
                  categorised its subject matter mandate into three broad areas: gross violations of
                  human rights; historical injustices; and other mandate areas.

             85.	     Before these mandate areas are discussed in detail, it is important to dispense
                      with two preliminary issues. Firstly, the TJR Act appears to create a distinction
                      between ‘human rights violations’ (presumably under national law) and ‘violations
                      of international human rights law’. The Commission considered this distinction to
                      be inconsequential. It is assumed and rightly so, that in referring to both ‘human
                      rights violations’ and ‘violations of international human rights law’, the lawmaker
                      wanted to be exhaustive and not to miss anything. However, the lawmaker was
                      clearly mistaken as to the possible difference in violations of human rights under
                      national and international law. What differs – and this was irrelevant to the work
                      of the Commission – is the forum at which victims may seek recourse. Sometimes
                      the remedies available and the protections afforded may be more extensive under
                      international law than at national law.

             86.	     Given that Kenya was already a party to the main international human rights
                      instruments for a good number of years during the mandate period,45 the
                      Commission looked seamlessly at both national law (Constitution and Statute) and
                      relevant international law in determining which rights were violated during the
                      mandate period. In any case, the Act sourced definitions of various concepts from
                      international law.

             87.	 Secondly, the Act appears to make a distinction between civil and political
                  rights, on the one hand and socio-economic rights, on the other. This is apparent
                  from section 5(a) and (b) which refer to ‘violations and abuses of human rights
                  and economic rights’ and ‘gross violations of human rights and economic rights’

                 Rights (CESCR); African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights; etc.

                                                                                                                     Vol u m e I    Chapter TWO




         respectively. The use of the disjunctive ‘and’ may appear to suggest that there is
         a difference between ‘human rights’, on the one hand, and ‘economic rights’, on
         the other. Again, this distinction is inconsequential. It is now established in human
         rights law and practice that all human rights are indivisible, interdependent and
         interrelated.46 As such, the traditional dichotomy drawn between civil and political
         rights and socio-economic rights has since been rejected.47

88.	     Apart from the conceptual linkages between civil and political rights and socio-
         economic rights, historical patterns of human rights violations in Kenya shows that
         violations of these two categories of rights work hand in hand. This was a point
         that the Makau Mutua Task Force considered when it recommended that a Kenyan
         truth commission should inquire into violations of both civil and political rights
         and socio-economic rights. According to the Task Force:
              It is a well-established fact in human rights law that all human rights – including
              economic, social and cultural rights – are indivisible, inter-dependent, and inter-related.
              Thus human rights law does not only refer to civil and political rights. The Republic of
              Kenya has an internationally binding obligation to protect all human rights, that is, civil
              and political rights, and economic, social and cultural rights, because it is a signatory
              to both the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International
              Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. That is why a truth commission
              should investigate the violations of civil and political rights as well as those of economic,
              social and cultural rights.48

89.	     Indeed, several chapters of this Report demonstrate the inherent linkages between
         civil and political rights and socio-economic rights.

90.	     The sub-sections that follow now focus on the three broad areas of the Commission’s
         subject matter mandate.

Gross violations of human rights
91.	     Although, as indicated above, it is not evidently clear whether the intention
         of Parliament was for the Commission to focus on ‘ordinary violations’ or ‘gross
         violations of human rights’, the Commission made a decision to focus on the latter.
         After a careful scrutiny of the TJR Act, the Commission concluded that there was a
         strong textual indication all over the Act to suggest that Parliament intended gross
         violations of human rights should be the focus of the Commission’s inquiry. In

                                        REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION                                          65
Volume I   Chapter TWO




                     section 5 and 6, the Act refers to ‘gross violations of human rights’ or ‘gross human
                     rights violations’ seven times.

             92.	    There are at least two additional reasons why the Commission believes its focus
                     on gross violations of human rights is accurate and valid. First, comparative
                     experience shows that gross violations of human rights have been the focus
                     of inquiries by truth commissions elsewhere.49 Despite contextual differences
                     between Kenya’s and other countries, there was no need for the Commission to
                     reinvent the wheel on this specific issue. The second reason was a matter of policy
                     and practical considerations. The Commission could not, even if it chose to do so,
                     inquire into all human rights violations, however petty, within a 45-year period. It
                     was not practical, in view of time and resource constraints.

             93.	    Having made the decision that it would focus on gross violations of human rights,
                     the Commission had to then define what this entailed. Of course, the starting
                     point was the TJR Act which defines ‘gross human rights violations’ to include the
                     following:

                              (a)	 violations of fundamental human rights, including but not limited to
                                   acts of torture, killing, abduction and severe ill-treatment of any person;

                              (b)	 imprisonment or other severe deprivation of physical property;

                              (c)	 rape or any other form of sexual violence;

                              (d)	 enforced disappearance of persons;

                              (e)	 persecution against any identifiable group or collectivity on political,
                                   racial, national, ethnic, cultural, religious or gender or other grounds
                                   universally recognised as impermissible under international law;

                              (f)	 any attempt, conspiracy, incitement, instigation, command, procurement
                                   to commit an act referred to in paragraph (a) and (c), which was committed
                                   during the period between 12 December 1963 and 28 February 2008 and
                                   the commission of which was advised, planned, directed, commanded or
                                   ordered, by any person acting with a political motive; or

                              (g)	 crimes against humanity.

             94.	    In terms of this definition, the Commission prioritised the following categories of
                     violations in its work and has dedicated a chapter to each in this report:

             49	 See for instance South African TRC; Sierra Leone TRC; and Liberian TRC.

                                                                                      Vol u m e I   Chapter TWO




       	   Unlawful killings and enforced disappearances (including political
            assassinations, extra-judicial killings and massacres);
       	   Unlawful detention, torture and ill-treatment; and
       	   Sexual violence.

95.	   Further, owing to its wide temporal mandate and for pragmatic reasons, the
       Commission had to be selective of the events it would concentrate on in terms of
       research and investigations. In this regard, the Commission prioritised violations
       committed in the following contexts:
       	   Shifta War (1965-1967);
       	   Security operations in North Eastern, Upper Eastern and North Rift (1963-2008);
       	   Attempted coup (1982);
       	   Crackdown on multi-party and pro-democracy activists (1986-1991);
       	   Ethnic and politically instigated clashes (1991/1992 and 1997);
       	   Activities of and crackdown on militia groups (2006-2007); and
       	   Post-election violence (2007-2008).

96.	   While in its research and investigations the Commission prioritised violations
       committed in the above contexts, it has captured and narrated in this Report many
       more violations that were committed in contexts beyond those listed above.

97.	 The three categories of violations listed above relate to violations of bodily
     integrity or more generally of civil and political rights. In addition to these and in
     accordance with the TJR Act, the Commission also focused on violations of socio-
     economic rights. This report has considered the subject in three different ways.

98.	   Firstly, the Commission considered the socio-economic impact of violations that
       targeted individual’s bodily integrity or their civil and political rights. As indicated
       earlier, violations of civil and political rights always go hand in hand with violations
       of socio-economic rights.

99.	   One of the findings of the Commission in this regard, for instance, is that most
       security operations in the country in which killings, torture and sexual crimes were
       committed, were also characterized by the burning of houses, theft or killing of
       cattle, looting of property and destruction of crops. The impact of these violations
       was particularly borne by the most vulnerable in society such as women, children,
       persons with disabilities and the elderly.

Volume I   Chapter TWO




             100.	 Secondly, the Commission considered socio-economic rights within its mandate
                   to inquire into and establish the reality or otherwise of perceived economic
                   marginalisation of communities. In this respect, the Commission considered
                   violations of socio-economic rights as independent violations.

             101.	 Finally, the Commission considered socio-economic violations within its mandate to
                   investigate economic crimes and grand corruption. As the Makau Mutua Task Force
                   report noted, ‘economic crimes lead to the violations of the entire gamut of human
                   rights and in particular of economic, social and cultural rights’.50


             Historical injustices
             102.	 Although the term ‘historical injustices’ is not used in the TJR Act, the notion of
                   ‘historical injustices’ pervades the debate on transitional justice in Kenya and has
                   since become a rallying cry for those seeking justice for past violations. There is
                   nevertheless ample proof that it was intended that the Commission would inquire
                   into what are regarded as ‘historical injustices’.

             103.	 This was clearly spelt out in the TJRC Agreement and the Memorandum of Objects
                   and Reasons attached to the TJR Bill. As already quoted above, the latter document
                   stated that:
                         The establishment of the Commission was conceived with a view to addressing historical
                         problems and injustices which, if left unaddressed, threatened the very existence of
                         Kenya as a modern society.

             104.	 However, ‘historical injustices’ is not a term of art. It entered Kenyan lexicon in the
                   context of activism and agitation for constitutional reform and establishment
                   of transitional justice mechanisms aimed at addressing past human rights
                   violations. In public discourse, the term refers to at least two things: Firstly, it refers
                   to exclusion and marginalisation (in terms of economic development) of certain
                   groups or regions and a range of violations supportive of this phenomenon.

             105.	 Secondly, it refers to dispossession and inequalities in the allocation of land in
                   a variety of ways by successive governments (or those associated with them)
                   in pre-independence and post-independence Kenya. For instance, during the
                   parliamentary debate that preceded the enactment of the TJR Act, a member of
                   Parliament observed that:

68           REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION
                                                                                                     Vol u m e I   Chapter TWO




             One of the functions of this Commission is to find the so-called historical injustices. I am
             one of the people who have been unable to understand what this so-called historical
             injustice is. I am saying this because it is more related to land, and more particularly, land
             in the Rift Valley.51

106.	 In other words, the term historical injustice has been used to describe issues of
      marginalisation and dispossession that resulted in disparities of income, wealth
      and opportunity that lie at the heart of many of the current conflicts in Kenya.
      In its report, the Commission of Inquiry into Post Election Violence, for instance,
      makes reference to ‘historical marginalisation, arising from perceived inequities
      concerning the allocation of land and other national resources as well as access to
      public goods and services’ as one of the main causes of inter-ethnic tensions and
      conflict.52

107.	 Thus, although the TJR Act does not expressly refer to historical injustices, it mandates
      the Commission to inquire into issues that fall under this term. First, section 6(p)
      mandates the Commission to ‘inquire into and establish the reality or otherwise of
      perceived economic marginalisation of communities and make recommendations
      on how to address the marginalisation’. Second, section 6(o) mandates the
      Commission to ‘inquire into the irregular and illegal acquisition of public land and
      make recommendations on the repossession of such land or the determination of
      cases relating thereto’.


Other mandate areas
108.	 In addition to gross violations of human rights and historical injustices, the
      Commission was mandated to investigate and/or carry out the following three
      functions:

         	    consider the reports of the relevant commissions of inquiry and make
               recommendations on the implementation of such reports;

         	    inquire into the misuse of public institutions for political objectives; and

         	    inquire into the causes of ethnic tensions and make recommendations on
               the promotion of healing, reconciliation and co-existence among ethnic
               communities.

Volume I   Chapter TWO




             Breadth and Complexity of Mandate
             109.	 As can be gleaned from the foregoing discussion, the Commission’s mandate was
                   both materially vast and complex. Truth commissions are ordinarily mandated to
                   focus only on gross violations of human rights. In addition to being mandated to
                   investigate gross violations of human rights, the Commission was also mandated
                   to investigate historical injustices and other issues that are rarely the focus of a
                   truth commission. The enormity of the task handed to the Commission is well
                   illustrated by the testimony of a witness who, speaking of only a single event, the
                   Wagalla Massacre, observed that:
                          If all the water is turned into ink with which to write, all the trees are turned into pens
                          with which to write, and all the land is turned into paper on which to write, the history
                          of Wagalla cannot be covered.53

             110.	 The breadth and complexity of its mandate, as measured against its resources and
                   life span, imposed on the Commission intense pressure. It also partly contributed
                   to the Commission’s inability to present its Report as it had been initially scheduled.


             Responsibility for Violations and Injustices
             111.	 The question of responsibility for violations and injustices committed during the
                   Commission’s mandate period was dealt with under section 5(a) and 6(b) of the TJR
                   Act. Section 5(a) restricted responsibility to the state, its organs and agents or former
                   agents. It required the Commission to establish a record of violations committed by
                   ‘the state, public institutions and holders of public office, both serving and retired’.
                   Thus, in ascribing responsibility to the state, the Commission adopted an approach
                   that was informed by the express language of the TJR Act and by international legal
                   principles concerning state responsibility. In particular, the Commission considered
                   that an act or omission of the following entities was attributable to the state:
                      	    state organs;
                      	    a person or entity who acts under the legal authority of the state to perform
                            governmental functions (and it does not matter whether the organ or entity
                            exercising governmental authority exceeds its authority or contravenes
                            instructions);
                      	    a person or group of persons acting on the instructions of, or under the
                            direction or control of, the state in carrying out the conduct; and

70           REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION
                                                                                                            Vol u m e I   Chapter TWO




         	   private entities, the activity of which is acknowledged and adopted as its own
              by the state.54

112.	 Section 6(b), on the other hand, expanded the list of those who could be held
      responsible for violations and injustices beyond the state. In addition to public
      institutions, public office holders, the state, state actors and persons purporting to
      have acted on behalf of a public body, it also lists the following: individuals, bodies
      and organisations. The Commission interpreted the reference to individuals,
      bodies and organisations to include persons other than state agents or persons
      purporting to act under the authority of the state.

113.	 As such, while the Commission primarily focused on violations perpetrated by
      the state and its agents, in certain respects it considered the actions of non-state
      actors, especially militia groups such as Mungiki, Chinkororo and the Sabaot
      Land Defence Force (SLDF). The Commission’s inclusion of non-state actors in its
      definition of perpetrators was fortified by the fact that this inclusion was necessary
      for the establishment of an accurate, complete and historical record of historical
      injustices and gross violations of human rights.


Amnesty
114.	 One of the most controversial provisions in the TJR Act concerns the Commission’s
      powers with respect to amnesty. Amnesties have been a much used, if controversial,
      mechanism in most transitions. While historically amnesties have been used and
      upheld even when they have applied to international crimes and other gross
      violations of human rights, there is now an established principle that amnesties
      for international crimes are prohibited under international law.

115.	 The TJR Bill included provisions granting the Commission power to recommend
      amnesty for a broad range of violations. Those powers were changed, in part,
      because of the successful lobbying of both domestic and international human
      rights organisations, who argued that international law prohibits the granting of
      amnesty for international crimes.

116.	 Thus, the first version of the TJR Act significantly restricted the range of violations
      for which amnesty could be granted. In particular, it provided that amnesty could
      not be granted for ‘gross violation[s] of human rights or an act, omission or offence

                      constituting a gross violation of human right[s] including extra-judicial execution,
                      enforced disappearance, sexual assault, rape and torture’. It also clearly indicated that
                      the Commission had powers to recommend but not to grant amnesty. However, the
                      Act still had several shortcomings in respect of the Commission’s amnesty powers.

             117.	 For example, the explanatory note in the margins of Part III of the Act relating to
                   amnesty stated ‘No amnesty for crimes against humanity’. This suggested that
                   amnesty could be granted for other international crimes, such as war crimes,
                   genocide, or torture. It also stated that the Commission could recommend amnesty
                   for a violation of ‘any international treaty to which Kenya is a party’.

             118.	 As such, there were some who feared that the specific reference to crimes against
                   humanity but not to genocide or war crimes might have suggested that the
                   Commission could recommend amnesty for genocide or war crimes.55 While the
                   Commission concedes that the language as originally drafted was somewhat
                   confusing with respect to its powers to recommend amnesty for genocide and
                   war crimes, the clear provision prohibiting it from recommending amnesty for
                   gross violations of human rights would clearly have prevented the Commission
                   from recommending amnesty for most acts that would qualify as either
                   genocide or a war crime.56

             119.	 In 2009, the TJR Act was amended to, amongst other reasons, make its amnesty
                   provisions conform to internationally accepted norms. The marginal note that
                   had read ‘No amnesty for crimes against humanity’ was amended to read ‘No
                   amnesty for international law crimes’. Moreover, the reference in section 34(2)
                   recommending amnesty for an act that violates ‘any international treaty to which
                   Kenya is a party’ was removed. Finally, the Act was amended to make it clear that
                   amnesty could not be granted for crimes against humanity or genocide.

             120.	 While the amendments made it clear that genocide, crimes against humanity and
                   most likely other international law crimes could not be the subject of an amnesty
                   recommendation, the Commission was still left to determine the acts, if any, for
                   which it had the power to recommend amnesty. The Act made it clear that the
                   Commission could not recommend amnesty for gross violations of human rights.

             55	 This fear was buttressed by the fact that the reference to no amnesty for crimes against humanity was only found in a marginal
                 note, and was not (until the 2009 Amendments) provided for in the text of the Act itself.
             56	 It is possible to argue that some minor acts that do not include violence against persons but might still qualify as genocide or
                 a war crime would not constitute a gross violation of human rights of the nature provided in the Act (which lists violations of
                 bodily integrity rights such as extrajudicial execution, enforced disappearance, sexual assault, rape, or torture). Thus some
                 might argue that cruel inhuman or degrading treatment that does not rise to the level of torture but is part of an armed conflict
                 or committed as part of a broader campaign of genocide might not fit within the prohibited acts for which the Commission could
                 not recommend amnesty. Given the 2009 amendments to the Act, the Commission did not have to address whether such acts
                 would or would not qualify as a gross violation of human rights.




72           REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION
                                                                                                                        Vol u m e I    Chapter TWO




121.	 While the amnesty provisions only made reference to acts of violence (extra-
      judicial execution, enforced disappearance, sexual assault, rape and torture),
      the Act defined gross human rights violations more broadly than this to include
      ‘violations of fundamental human rights’.57

122.	 Given these restrictions on its powers, the Commission undertook a number of
      consultations with various stakeholders to better understand the limitations on
      its amnesty powers and to discuss the opportunities, if any, its amnesty powers
      provided with respect to furthering its mandate with respect to truth, justice and
      reconciliation.

123.	 After internal deliberation and consultations with stakeholders, the Commission
      decided to forego exercising the powers granted to it to recommend amnesty.
      There are several reasons for this. First, given the broad definition of gross
      violations of human rights in the Act, the type of acts for which the Commission
      could recommend amnesty is very limited. The Commission generally adopted an
      expansive view of what qualified as a gross violation of human rights in order to
      provide a forum to as many witnesses as possible.

124.	 Second, given the limited acts for which amnesty could be recommended and the
      fact that it could only recommend and not grant amnesty, the Commission did not
      anticipate that much additional truth would come out of the amnesty process. The
      amnesty administered by the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission
      (which was clearly the primary model for the amnesty provisions provided in
      the Act), was able to grant amnesty itself and was not clearly prohibited from
      considering amnesty for gross violations of human rights and even international
      crimes. The South African Commission did grant amnesty for, among other things,
      acts of torture, enforced disappearances, extra-judicial killings and other acts that
      are clearly outside of this Commission’s power to recommend amnesty. While
      some have criticised the South African amnesty for foregoing justice for such
      crimes, others argue that new information was revealed about some of the worst
      violations committed during the apartheid years.

125.	 Regardless of whether one views the South African amnesty as having been a
      success in contributing to the truth of apartheid-era violations, there is no question
      that the limited amnesty powers provided in the TJR Act would not have provided
      a similar opportunity to the Commission.

57	 TJRC Act, sec 2. While the definitions section refers to ‘gross human rights violations’ and the amnesty section to ‘gross
    violation of human rights’ we do not think that the drafters intended to be referring to two different concepts, but instead use
    the two phrases interchangeably to refer to the same violations.

             Other Relevant Aspects of the Commission’s
             Mandate
             Application of the Indemnity Act
             126.	 In 1972 the Kenyan Parliament passed the Indemnity Act,58 which restricts the ability
                   of individuals to make claims arising from acts committed by the Kenya armed forces
                   and others acting on behalf of the government for any act they committed during
                   the so-called Shifta War (25 December 1963 – 1 December 1967). The restriction on,
                   among other things, any proceeding or claim to compensation is itself restricted to
                   acts committed only in a part of Kenya: the former North Eastern Province and Lamu,
                   Tana River, Marsabit and Isiolo districts.

             127.	 The Indemnity Act thus purports to institutionalise impunity for human rights
                   violations committed by those acting on behalf of the government during a
                   prescribed time and in a prescribed area. In other words, it attempts to create a
                   separate legal regime with respect to accountability for the Shifta War.

             128.	 To qualify for legal protection under the Indemnity Act, an individual’s action must
                   have been done in good faith and ‘done or purported to be done in the execution of
                   duty in the interests of public safety or the maintenance of public order, otherwise
                   in the public interest’.59

             129.	 Since the passage of the Indemnity Act many have argued for its repeal, including
                   and not surprisingly, residents of the affected areas. Parliament voted to repeal the
                   Indemnity Act in 2010. The President however refused to assent to the repeal and
                   thus the Indemnity Act continues to be part of the laws of Kenya.

             130.	 From its inception, concerns were raised about the impact of the Indemnity Act on
                   the Commission’s work. Some were concerned that the Indemnity Act prevented
                   the Commission from investigating, researching, discussing, or commenting on
                   violations that occurred in the areas and during the times covered by the Act. Others
                   argued that the Commission should devote some of its operational resources to
                   pushing for repeal of the Indemnity Act. Still others refused to engage with the
                   Commission unless and until the Act was repealed.

             131.	 Speaking of the Indemnity Act before the Commission, a witness lamented:
                           What a gross violation of human rights and absolute abuse of democracy that has
                           been legitimized under the law! It was this period between 25th December 1963 to 1st
                           December 1967 that gross human rights violations and atrocities were meted out on the
                           residents of Northern Kenya. It is something so strange that section 3(b) says ‘if it is done
             58	 Chapter 44, Laws of Kenya.
             59	 Indemnity Act, sec 3(1) (a)-(b).

                                                                                                                    Vol u m e I   Chapter TWO




             in good faith’. I wonder whether the killing of our people, raping of our wives, killing our
             animals were done in good faith.60

132.	 Another witness expressed similar sentiments:
             I do not want to go into the details of the Act, but it puzzles me … I am yet to understand
             whether human rights can be grossly and systematically violated and abused in good
             faith and whether such violations and abuses further any known public interest.61

133.	 In interpreting the scope of its mandate, the Commission obviously had to address
      the applicability and effect of the Indemnity Act on its activities. After thoroughly
      considering the issue, the Commission concluded that the Indemnity Act did not
      apply to the work of the Commission and thus could not restrict in any way the
      work of the Commission. There are two arguments that support the Commission’s
      conclusion.

134.	 First, the Indemnity Act makes it clear that its restrictions with respect to
      accountability do not apply to ‘the institution or prosecution of proceedings
      on behalf of the government’.62 This section makes clear that the focus of the
      legislation is on restricting the right of private individuals to bring a claim for
      compensation or other form of accountability.

135.	 The Commission is an independent government commission that was created
      by and works on behalf of the government. As such the Commission clearly is
      engaged in ‘proceedings on behalf of the government’ and thus its operations are
      excluded from the provisions of the Indemnity Act.

136.	 Second, even if one were to argue that the Indemnity Act by its terms applies to and
      thus restricts the powers of the Commission, the passage of the TRJ Act, which, under
      this argument, conflicts with the provisions of the Indemnity Act, would prevail as it
      was passed after the Indemnity Act. It is a fundamental principle of the rule of law
      that if two pieces of legislation conflict, the one passed later in time applies unless
      the later legislation makes clear that it is subject to the previous legislation.

137.	 In this case, Parliament passed the TJR Act in 2008 and decided not to make the
      Commission subject to the Indemnity Act. This argument is strengthened by the fact
      that Parliament did expressly indicate that the Commission is subject to other pieces
      of legislation that conflict with the TJR Act, such as the Protected Areas Act.63

62	 Indemnity Act, sec 4(a).
63	 The Protected Areas Act, which governs access to certain sensitive government buildings and facilities, conflicts with the
    general power granted to the Commission to ‘visit any establishment or place without giving prior notice’. TJR Act sec 7(2)
    (b). Parliament made clear that notwithstanding the power to visit any establishment without prior notice, the Commission
    was still bound by the provisions of the Protected Areas Act. TJR Act sec 7(4).

Volume I   Chapter TWO




             Choice of terminologies
             138.	 Truth Commissions have grappled with how best to refer to individuals who
                   were affected by or are responsible for gross violations of human rights. The
                   Commission, like other truth commissions around the world, had a strong victim
                   focus. The TJR Act directed the Commission to elicit the views and perspectives of
                   victims, restore their dignity and determine ways and means of providing them
                   with redress. The term ‘victim’ is also defined in the Act essentially as any person
                   or group who has suffered any harm, loss or damage as a result of a human rights
                   violation.64

             139.	 However, while the TJR Act refers to perpetrators, it does not define the term. It is
                   clear, however, that the term perpetrator refers to an individual who bears some
                   responsibility for a gross violation of human rights or other violation within the
                   mandate of the Commission. Both terms (victim and perpetrator) thus presuppose
                   a determination that, in the case of victims, an individual has suffered harm, loss or
                   damage as a result of a violation, or in the case of perpetrators, are responsible for
                   a violation. In other words, both require that a determination be made with respect
                   to the existence of a violation and either harm or responsibility arising from that
                   violation.

             140.	 So as not to prejudge the existence of a violation, harm, or responsibility and to
                   better fulfil its obligations to provide ‘victims, perpetrators and the general public
                   with a platform for non-retributive truth-telling’,65 to promote reconciliation and
                   national unity and to respect the dignity and value of all Kenyans, the Commission
                   decided to refer to all individuals who engaged with the Commission as witnesses,
                   rather than as victims or perpetrators. With respect to those who others named
                   as being perpetrators of a particular violation, the Commission adopted the term
                   ‘adversely mentioned person’ again so as not to prejudge whether an individual
                   indeed qualified as a perpetrator with respect to a specific violation.

             141.	 Depending on the evidence collected by the Commission with respect to a
                   particular violation, an adversely mentioned person may be identified in this report
                   as being responsible for a particular violation (and thus correctly identified as a
                   perpetrator of that violation), or as an individual who some have accused, but for
                   whom there is insufficient evidence for the Commission to assert with confidence
                   their responsibility, or as an individual for whom the evidence suggests has no
                   responsibility for a particular violation.

142.	 In addition, many individuals qualify as both victims and perpetrators. In fact for
      some perpetrators it is their experience as victims which push them to become
      perpetrators, sometimes in the name of vindicating either real or perceived
      violations suffered by themselves, their families, or their community. Much of the
      violations involving ethnic tension and ethnic violence may be better understood
      by acknowledging the dual experiences of individuals and communities as having
      attributes of both victims and perpetrators. As such, The Commission deemed it
      inappropriate to refer to a person as a victim or perpetrator as such a designation
      only reflects one part of that individual’s experience.

143.	 The manner in which individuals engaged with the Commission underscored the
      problematic nature of referring to individuals as victims or perpetrators. While
      the Commission referred to individuals who engaged with the Commission as
      witnesses, individuals self-identified themselves and others using terms like victims,
      survivors and perpetrators. Some who qualified as victims under the Act referred to
      themselves as survivors, choosing to adopt a term that emphasized their present
      and future survival rather than their past victimization. For instance, David Onyango
      Oloo expressed the views of many who suffered from violations of the past:
            What a waste of time the Moi KANU regime went through, plucking university students
            from their classrooms and homes and dumping them in filthy dungeons. It did not
            stop anything. Did it? We are still here. Are we not? We survived. Did we not? Yes, we
            are survivors and not victims. We are victorious overcomers and not carcasses of state
            oppression. They tried to bury us alive but we defiantly emerged from the graves called
            maximum security penitentiaries. We are still here standing up and fighting for peace,
            justice and democracy. You can lock people up but no oppressor has yet found a way of
            imprisoning patriotic, democratic and revolutionary ideas.66

144.	 Another witness, Wahinya Bore, echoed this position:
            We are not victims but people who are simply victorious. We are not carcasses of state
            oppression or repression. We are people who are strong. Let it not be seen as if victims
            are begging for mercy or to be heard. No! We want the world to know that something
            happened somewhere in Kenya. The issue here is that there is a constituency of some
            people in this particular country who fought for the liberation of this particular country,
            but they have never been recognised.67

145.	 Regardless of how they chose to describe themselves, this Report is a tribute to the
      thousands of individuals who suffered the various forms of violations and injustices
      recorded here and in the Commission’s database.

               Methodology and Process


Introduction
1.	     The Commission adopted procedures and policies which conformed to internationally
        accepted standards for truth commissions and truth seeking initiatives. The
        Commission’s reference materials in this regard included the General Principles and
        Parameters for the Truth, Justice and Reconciliation (TJRC Agreement), Truth Justice
        and Reconciliation Act (TJR Act) and the United Nations Principles for the Protection
        and Promotion of Human Rights through Action to Combat Impunity.

2.	     The TJRC Agreement provided that:
            The Commission shall receive statements from victims, witnesses, communities, interest
            groups, persons directly involved in events, or any other group or individual; undertake
            investigations and research, hold hearings; and engage in activities as it determines to
            advance national or community reconciliation. The Commission may offer confidentiality
            to persons upon request in order to protect individual privacy or security, or for other
            reasons. The Commission shall solely determine whether its hearings shall be held in
            public or in camera.
 
3.	     The TJR Act also gave the Commission ‘all powers necessary for the execution of
        its functions’.1 These included the power to: gather information by any means it

                     deemed appropriate; visit establishments or places for the purpose of obtaining
                     information; interview individuals; call upon individuals to attend its hearings;
                     require statements to be given under oath; request and/or compel the production
                     of information; and issue summons as it deemed necessary.

             4.	     The Commission structured its operational work under four mutual and overlapping
                     phases:

                     	    statement-taking;

                     	    research and investigations;

                     	    hearings; and

                     	    report writing.

             5.	     The public was educated about these processes through the Commission’s civic
                     education and outreach programmes and activities. Where appropriate, the
                     Commission opened up its procedures to external review and used the reports
                     and recommendations of such reviews to strengthen its processes.

Civic Education and Outreach
Starting out
6.	     The Commission’s functions, as spelt out in its founding legal instrument included
        ‘educating and engaging the public and giving sufficient publicity to its work so
        as to encourage the public to contribute positively to the achievement of the
        objectives of the Commission’ and ‘informing the public of its existence and the
        purpose of its work’.2 To fulfil on this requirement, the Commission carried out
        civic education and outreach activities to allow full and active public participation
        in its work and processes. These civic education and outreach activities were also
        a means of building ownership of both the Commission’s processes and its final
        report among Kenyans.

7.	     Civic education and outreach activities were initially delayed by lack of funds
        which made it impossible for the Commission to educate and engage with
        the public as mandated. This was only possible from August 2010 - a year after
        Commissioners were sworn in. The controversy over the suitability and credibility
        of the Chairperson derailed several planned activities including civic education
        and outreach. It also crippled efforts to engage with civil society and development
        partners for assistance and support.
 
8.	     The Commission received funds in July 2010 and immediately proceeded to
        establish its Civic Education and Outreach Department with responsibility for
        coordinating all the Commission’s civic education and outreach activities. The
        Department started by developing a Strategy and Work Plan before rolling out
        key activities in November 2010. The roll-out followed soon after the Chairperson
        took the decision to step aside and allow inquiry into his suitability to hold office.

9.	     Recognising the financial and time constraints faced by the Commission,3 the
        Department established partnerships with organisations including Kituo cha
        Sheria, African Centre for the Constructive Resolution of Disputes (ACCORD),
        International Organization for Migration (IOM), Action Aid, and others to facilitate
        some of its operations and activities. Kituo cha Sheria disseminated information
        about the Commission’s mandate and work in its outreach programmes in the
        provinces of Nairobi, Nyanza and Rift Valley. The IOM incorporated aspects of the
        Commission’s mandate and processes in its inter community dialogue and peace
        meetings among pastoralists communities in Northern Kenya, particularly in

                     Kakuma, Pokot, Kapenguria, Dadaab and Garissa. The structured assistance of civil
                     society partners enabled the Civic Education and Outreach Department to expand
                     its reach and work.

             Specific activities
             10.	    The Civic Education and Outreach Department conducted a number of activities
                     including training of stakeholders, hosting workshops and meetings, and
                     participation in barazas and Agricultural Society of Kenya (ASK) shows in an
                     effort to reach as many people as possible from all sectors of society.
              
             11.	    The Department’s major activity involved conducting pre-hearing civic education
                     drives around the country. These drives served a three-fold objective: informing the
                     public about the Commission’s work and processes; managing public expectations;
                     and creating a receptive environment for the hearings that were to follow. The
                     drives used interactive and participatory approaches that allowed participants
                     to seek clarification and engage in discussions. Most of these drives were held in
                     town halls but in some areas they took the form of open-air gatherings or barazas.
                     Participation was open to the general public, different groups of victims, community
                     leaders (including representatives of councils of elders and political leaders), as
                     well as members of professional organisations and the business community.
              
             12.	 To ensure inclusiveness in its civic education and outreach activities, the
                  Commission organised special workshops and meetings that created space and
                  a conducive atmosphere for expression and discussion of the various experiences
                  of specific vulnerable groups. Such forums were organised for women, youth,
                  children, persons with disabilities, internally displaced persons, slum dwellers,
                  squatters, evictees and survivors of particular episodes of human rights violations.

             13.	    The Commission designed and produced information, education and communication
                     (IEC) materials that were distributed to individuals through various outlets, including
                     public events and functions of the Commission. IEC materials included brochures
                     summarising the Commission’s processes, posters with pictures promoting peace
                     and dialogue, fliers with specific information and messages on public hearings and
                     Commission branded products such as T-shirts, scarves and khangas.



                      To ensure inclusiveness in its civic education and outreach activities,
                        the Commission organised special workshops and meetings that
                          created space and a conducive atmosphere for expression and
                       discussion of the various experiences of specific vulnerable groups.

Statement-Taking
14.	   Statement-taking is not only one of the primary sources of information for truth
       commissions but it is also a major avenue through which individuals interact with
       a truth commission. The number of statements collected provides an indication of
       the interest of individuals in a truth telling process. The Commission collected a
       total of 42,465 statements. This high level of participation confirmed the findings
       of the Makau Mutua Task Force that there was overwhelming desire for a truth-
       seeking process in Kenya. 
 
15.	   The process sought statements from victims and witnesses of various forms
       of human rights violations. It provided victims, their families and witnesses the
       opportunity to tell their stories. The process gave voice to a multitude of stories
       and perspectives about violations that had occurred in Kenya’s history.
 
16.	   The Commission was fully aware that the process of sharing experiences of
       gross human rights violations could be traumatic for victims. As such, Statement
       Takers were trained on how to assist victims deal with trauma. Moreover, aware
       of the importance of the need for inclusion and participation in a truth seeking
       process, the Commission ensured that the statement taking process was inclusive,
       accessible and safe.  In particular:

       	   the Commission recruited Statement Takers from all regions of the country to
            ensure broad geographical reach for the statement-taking process;

       	   individuals were free to give statements in the language of their choice,
            although the statement taking forms were filled out in English;

       	   individuals could request a different statement taker to record their statement if
            they were uncomfortable giving their statement to the person before them (for
            example, an elderly person could choose not to give a statement to someone
            much younger than them);

       	   the Commission learned from the experience of other truth commissions that
            women were less likely to give their statements to male Statement Takers. For
            this reason, as far as it was possible, statements from women were taken by
            female Statement Takers; and

       	   the Commission made special provisions to reach out to those who could not
            normally access a statement taker. For example, the Commission deployed 16
            Statement Takers to prisons across the country.

             Statement Form
             17.	 The Commission designed a Statement Form to capture information from
                  witnesses.4 The Statement Form was designed to ensure the gathering of as
                  much information as possible about gross violations of human rights. The Form
                  was designed to capture this information from both victims and perpetrators,
                  but no single perpetrator volunteered information through this avenue. This was
                  so despite the fact that individuals who were adversely mentioned in Statement
                  Forms or during the hearings were so notified and requested by the Commission
                  to file a statement.
              
             18.	 Human Rights Information and Documentation Systems (HURIDOCS), an
                  internationally recognised organisation in human rights data gathering and
                  analysis, reviewed the Statement Form and found it met internationally accepted
                  standards for tools designed to gather information about human rights violations.
                  HURIDOCS described the Commission’s statement taking form as ‘one of the most
                  sophisticated we have seen from a truth commission’.
              
             Initial Statement-Taking Exercise
             19.	 The Commission undertook an initial statement taking exercise in Mt Elgon
                  in May and June 2010. This was, in effect, a pilot project conducted for two
                  reasons.  Firstly, the Commission used the exercise to get feedback from victims
                  and other witnesses about the statement-taking methodology, including the
                  Statement Form. Secondly, the exercise enabled the Commission to begin its main
                  operational activities immediately, despite the fact that resources to hire staff were
                  yet to be received. This inadequacy of financial and human resources through the
                  first year of the Commission’s establishment hindered the start of a nation-wide
                  exercise until July 2010. Rather than wait for the availability of adequate resources,
                  the Commission took the opportunity of the initial exercise to strengthen the tools
                  it would work with and learn from the mistakes of other truth commissions that
                  had not field-tested their statement-taking form and methodology. 

             20.	    The Commission found the initial statement-taking exercise extremely valuable
                     because:
                      	   it allowed the Commission to interact on a one-on-one basis with victims
                           and witnesses and to gain valuable insights into how to elicit the range of
                           violations and experiences of statement givers;

             4	 See Appendix 4 for the Statement Form.

       	   it permitted Commissioners to participate first hand in the day to day activities
            of statement- taking, an experience that would enrich their ability to guide
            the national statement-taking process and to understand and process the
            information more thoroughly in connection with public hearings;

       	   the exercise elicited information that allowed the Commission to refine its
            statement-taking form and statement-taking methodology; and

       	   the statement-taking exercise provided an opportunity for the Commission to
            engage with its core mandate functions despite the challenges that up until
            that point had primarily limited the Commission’s activities to Nairobi.
 
Training of Statement Takers
21.	   The Commission recruited 304 Statement Takers - 113 male and 191 female. They
       were trained between 23 August 2010 and 9 September 2010 to prepare them for
       their task. The Commission developed a curriculum with four major areas of focus:
       transitional justice, human rights, and the mandate of the Commission; gender
       perspectives in statement taking; trauma management and the statement taking-
       form and process. Training workshops were held in each of the eight provincial
       headquarters and were conducted by staff of the Commission with the assistance of
       consultants.
 
Statement-Taking
22.	   The nation-wide statement taking exercise was officially launched on 9 September
       2010 and lasted five months. It was anticipated that some individuals would be
       unwilling or unable to record statements during the formal statement taking
       exercise and so the Commission, continued to record and receive statements and
       memoranda at its offices and during individual and thematic hearings.

23.	   The Commission travelled around the country conducting civic education and
       individual hearings which increased its visibility significantly and resulted in many
       more people coming forward to record statements. The Commission re-engaged
       a limited number of Statement Takers during the pre-hearing stage to record
       statements for a period of two weeks in each specific area.
 
24.	   The Commission cultivated a number of important partnerships with civil society
       organisations around the statement-taking exercise. The main partners in this
       regard were Action-Aid and Kituo cha Sheria. Action-Aid partnered with the
       Commission in statement-taking in Mt. Elgon and the Coast region while Kituo
       cha Sheria focused entirely on the Coast region. Both organisations recruited

Volume I   Chapter THREE




                     Statement Takers who received training based on the curriculum developed by
                     the Commission before being deployed in the field. They would then forward the
                     statements to the Commission.

             25.	    Despite the huge number of statements recorded the Commission continued to
                     receive complaints that individuals had not been able to record their statements.
                     This continuous expression of interest in recording statements underscored the
                     depth of interest in a truth telling process as well as the increased credibility of the
                     Commission as it embarked upon activities relating to its core functions. 

             Review of Statement-Taking
             26.	    In November 2010, the Commission  reviewed the statement-taking process in
                     consultative meetings with CSOs based in all eight provinces. The review had
                     a three-fold objective: to identify gaps and critical issues emanating from the
                     statement taking process; to assess the quality of information received through
                     the statement taking process; to assess the level of participation of vulnerable
                     groups (such as women, persons with disabilities, etc) in the process.

             27.	    Through these review meetings, the Commission established working arrangements
                     with local organisations some of which later supported the statement-taking
                     process through civic education and mobilisation of their respective constituents.
                     At the end of the statement-taking session, debriefing sessions for Statement
                     Takers were held in each province and included psychosocial support to help them
                     cope with the stress of having to hear traumatic accounts from victims.

             Statements by Children
             28.	    As is the case with other vulnerable groups, the TJR Act allowed the Commission to
                     put in place special arrangements and adopt specific mechanisms and procedures
                     to address the experiences of children. Consistent with the Kenyan law and
                     international practice, the Commission defined a child as any human being under
                     the age of 18 years.
              
             29.	    A Stakeholders’ Workshop on the Participation of Children in the Commission’s
                     Process was held on 7 October 2011 in Nairobi. The purpose of the meeting was
                     to consult child protection agencies and other stakeholders on best practices in
                     taking statements and organising hearings involving children.
              
             30.	    Taking statements from children requires special skills and considerations. A distinct
                     training programme was therefore designed for statement takers who would engage

         with children and record their statements. The scope of the training included aspects
         relating to: the different evolving capacities of children and processes suited to those
         capacities; the need to ensure children’s free participation without interfering with
         their other entitlements such as education or play; the need to avoid stigmatisation
         or discrimination; and the need to obtain consent from the parents, caregivers or
         guardians of a child. A total of 40 statement takers - drawn from the Commission,
         child protection agencies and individual professional counselling organisations –
         were trained under programme.
 
31.	     A special Children’s Statement-Taking Form was also prepared in consultation
         with child protection agencies and was pre-tested in October 2011 to assess its
         suitability and effectiveness in taking statements from children. The draft was
         subsequently revised to incorporate insights from the pre-testing exercise.5
 
32.	     The 40 statement takers were then guided on the use of the Children’s Statement
         Form before they were deployed to take statements from children for a period of
         one month. A total of 996 statements were collected from children:  500 from boys
         and 496 from girls. 
 
33.	     On the basis of these statements, the Commission subsequently organised a
         thematic hearing for children in December 2011, details of which are discussed
         later in this Chapter.

Volume I   Chapter THREE




               A group submitting a memorandum to the Commission’s Vice Chairperson, Commissioner Tecla Namachanja



             Memoranda
             34.	    Statements recorded by individual victims or witnesses provided the bulk of raw
                     information for the Commission. In addition, memoranda were also collected
                     by the Commission. Generally, memoranda were submitted by representatives
                     of affected communities or groups, but in some instances also by individuals.
                     Memoranda provided information beyond the limits of the Statement Form.
                     Groups and individuals could include longer narrations of the history, context and
                     causes of violations.

             35.	 The Commission developed and distributed guidelines to ensure that the
                  memoranda incorporated pertinent information such as the names of individuals
                  involved and a comprehensive description of where, when, why and how the
                  alleged violations occurred. Similar to the Statement Form, the guidelines
                  relating to the memoranda also requested a brief outline of the expectations and
                  recommendations of the affected groups or individuals.

             36.	    A memorandum was also a means by which a group of people or community
                     developed, through a consultative and participatory manner, an agreed narrative
                     of what they had experienced. In the process, harmony was fostered within the
                     community. For instance, in Marsabit, the Commission received a memorandum
                     prepared by Marsabit Inter-Ethnic Consultative Group which described itself
                     as ‘a non-registered entity which was purposely formed to consult on the
                     historical injustices that were faced by the people in this county with a view to
                     comprehensively presenting them before the Commission’.6 A representative of

88           REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION
                                                                                       Vol u m e I   Chapter THREE




       the Group explained to the Commission the reason behind its formation and the
       impact of developing a joint memorandum:
          When we drafted this memorandum, we appreciated the fact that the Commission
          is not just a Truth and Justice Commission, but a Truth, Justice and Reconciliation
          Commission. We valued the inherent good in doing a collective memo because
          we cannot cheat ourselves. If every community were to stand here and present its
          separate memorandum, especially on issues relating to ethnic conflict, there would be
          accusations and counter accusations which may give us the truth and justice, but defeat
          the object of reconciliation. By coming together, we have diffused that tension and we
          believe that our efforts will crystallize towards [reconciliation].

37.	   The Commission continued receiving memoranda beyond the statement taking
       exercise and throughout the hearings phase. In total, the Commission received
       1529 memoranda from individuals, groups, associations and communities.

Information and Data Management
Records Management
38.	   The ICT and Documentation Department was responsible for the organization and
       management of the Commission’s print and electronic records. The Department
       developed an organization-wide file plan based on an internally developed
       taxonomy to guide the naming and filing of official records. The development
       of the file plan was informed by the functions and nature of records created and
       used by the various departments of the Commission. The operational records were
       classified by function while the substantive records by subject. 


                              REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION                       89
Volume I   Chapter THREE




             39.	    The Commission had in its custody records of a sensitive nature such as the
                     statements collected from the public, proceedings of both public and in-camera
                     hearings, evidence materials and investigation reports. These records had to be
                     protected to ensure they were available when needed and that their integrity was
                     maintained (that they were not altered).
              
             40.	    The degree of sensitivity or confidentiality of a record was based on the gravity
                     of damage which its unauthorized disclosure could likely cause any individual or
                     group. Protection against unauthorized access to records or access by unauthorized
                     persons required sound procedures for handling access protocols. As such, access
                     to records was based on the following classification:
                     	    Open records: for unclassified records whose access was limited to the
                           Commission’s staff;
                     	    Confidential records: for records that required written authority to access
                           from the originating department;
                     	    Strictly confidential: for records that required direct written authorization for
                           access from the CEO.
              
             41.	    The security classification of records determined how records were stored; the
                     confidential and strictly confidential records were secured in disaster proof safes
                     in the office and in a vault at a local commercial bank respectively. These security
                     measures also applied to electronic records which were stored mainly in shared
                     electronic drives with a requirement for access passwords. Moreover, all confidential
                     and strictly confidential electronic files were protected by various encryption levels.

             Electronic Database
             42.	    In order to organise, manage and statistically analyse the information received
                     through statements and memoranda, the Commission created an electronic
                     database that facilitated the input, storage, retrieval and analysis of data. A team
                     brought together by HURIDOCS provided technical support in the creation of
                     the database while the United Nations Office of the High Commission for Human
                     Rights (OHCHR) offered financial support.

             43.	    Ideally the design of a database is undertaken either before or simultaneously
                     with the design of the Statement-Taking Form and procedures. However, given
                     the financial and other constraints that have been mentioned, the Commission
                     was unable to prepare the general Statement-Taking Form at the same time as the
                     Children’s Statement-Taking Form. The latter was developed near the end of the
                     national statement-taking process.

	         Designing the database
44.	       The development of the database began with a needs assessment to ensure
           that it was designed to meet the specific needs of the Commission. This was
           undertaken by a project team comprised of three experts from HURIDOCS, Stataid
           and BoldEverything (the ‘Data Team’). The Data Team spent a week in Nairobi,
           from 31 January to 4 February 2011, during which it met with Commissioners
           and staff members (mainly the management team, researchers, IT technicians,
           and the statement manager).

45.	       On 1 February 2011, the Data Team reviewed the Statement Form together with
           the Commission’s Researchers. The review discussed the best way to represent in
           the database, the information presented in the Statement Form. The Statement
           Form was reviewed line by line. For each question, the group discussed whether
           the data should be maintained in the database and, if so, what was the best format
           for the data (qualitative, quantitative, or both). The discussion lasted many hours
           and covered the entire database.

46.	       In the end the following tasks related to the design of the database were completed:
           determination of database specifications and requirements; collection of variables
           and initial quality analysis for statements emanating from North Eastern Province;
           a preliminary determination of the human resources required for coding and data
           entry; and determination of ICT assurance and data security protocols.

Volume I   Chapter THREE




             	      Tracking Log for Statements
             47.	    Each Statement Form had an identification number, ranging from 00001 to 50000.
                     This allowed each statement to be individually tracked. With the initial assistance
                     of the Data Team, the Commission prepared an Excel Spreadsheet tracking log
                     with a row for each statement using their respective identification numbers. The
                     log was used for multiple purposes:

                     	    Determining the statement status: Statements could either be blank, filled
                           out, incomplete, cancelled, damaged, destroyed, or missing. Knowing a
                           Statement’s status was helpful for determining how many statements had
                           been used at any particular time and whether each statement had been coded
                           and entered into the electronic database.

                     	    Maintaining a record of the physical location of the statement: Because
                           almost all statements contained confidential information, it was imperative
                           that all statements be returned from the field and then carefully tracked if
                           they were not in storage. The tracking log therefore contained a variable that
                           indicated the physical location of a statement at any particular time. This
                           ensured a greater degree of data security.

                     	    Organising coding and data entry steps: The tracking log was used to assign
                           particular statements to particular coders or data entry staff on particular
                           days. It was also used to maintain a record of which statements had been
                           coded and which still needed to be coded. It was also used to randomize the
                           order in which statements were coded and entered into the database, to allow
                           the database at any particular time of its development to represent the full set
                           of statements in an unbiased way. Thus as the coding and data entry process
                           continued, statistics could be generated and the emerging patterns in the
                           data could be ascertained.


             	      Data Coding and Entry
             48.	 Feeding information into the Database was a two-track process. First, the
                  information contained in the Statement Forms was transferred into a coding
                  sheet. The coding sheet served as a uniform template for feeding data into the
                  database. In the second instance, the coded information was entered into the
                  electronic database.

             49.	    The coding process was guided by a Coding Manual. Its main purpose was to
                     stipulate fixed data coding, entry, and management practices and protocols, to
                     ensure that the Database is based on consistent and reliable standards and that it

       is independent from external influences or other unforeseen factors. The Coding
       Manual also established principles of confidentiality and addressed matters of
       protection of confidential information handled by the coders. Thus, the Manual
       was designed as a reference by which staff could ensure that high-quality data
       storage practices and the appropriate handling of data were maintained at all
       times.

50.	   In August 2011, the Commission recruited a total of 30 Statement Coders who
       were trained to convert the qualitative narratives contained in statements and
       memoranda into quantitative parameters that could generate statistical analyses.
       Together with the Database Manager, the Coders and Data Entry Clerks signed a
       Statement of Confidentiality.

51.	   The Database Manager oversaw the coding process and the overall functioning
       of the database. She was responsible for ensuring that the procedures outlined
       in the Manual were followed with great care. Any questions, uncertainty, or
       ambiguities that Coders or Data Entry Clerks encountered during their work were
       to be directed to the Database Manager. Caution was crucial for data coding or
       data entry personnel and in a situation of uncertainty were to approach the
       Database Manager to ensure accuracy of the coding and data entry processes.

52.	   The coding process took five months from August to December 2011.

	     Evaluating the database
53.	   Throughout the data entry and coding process, the Database Manager periodically
       reviewed and compared the inputted data with the content of the Coding Sheet.
       She conducted the review at least every two weeks as a matter of course although
       the frequency of reviews depended on her analysis of the work of each individual
       coder. For purposes of quality control, the Database Manager was responsible for
       arranging periodic dual data entry for a random subset of statements. She also
       implemented other methods for testing data quality as she deemed necessary.

54.	   In December 2011, following the conclusion of the coding process, the Commission
       embarked on the evaluation of the entire database. A two track approach was
       adopted. Firstly, an internal data entry quality analysis was undertaken to check
       for duplication and other errors in the database. In particular, entries were cross-
       verified and appropriate action taken where it was found that individuals had
       recorded multiple statements. The evaluation also ensured that all statements and
       memoranda had been fed into the database. This was done by cross-checking the
       entries in the database against a manual statement/memoranda log.

Volume I   Chapter THREE




             55.	    Secondly, the Database was evaluated by an external independent consultant.
                     The evaluation, which was financially supported by ICTJ, assessed the reliability
                     of the database through identification of any factors that could affect analysis
                     of the collected data. From 12 to 16 December 2011, the independent reviewer
                     undertook a data assessment mission to the Commission. He held a series of
                     meetings with both the Commissioners and with the technical team in charge of
                     the database. In particular, between 13 and 15 December 2011, he worked closely
                     with the Commission’s Directors for Research and for ICT and Documentation,
                     and the Database Manager to evaluate the data collection and management
                     processes and to identify any challenges that could affect the data analysis phase.
                     As the Independent Consultant observed, the Commission’s technical personnel
                     were, in many instances, well aware of the potential challenges, and using his
                     expert knowledge and comparative experience from the Peruvian Commission,
                     the independent consultant provided mainly technical guidance on possible
                     solutions to address identified challenges.

             56.	    At the end of the exercise, the independent consultant recommended ways to address
                     identified challenges and the Commission acted on these recommendations.


             Research and Investigations
             57.	    The Commission used both primary and secondary materials in its research into the
                     various mandate areas. Primary materials comprised of statements, memorandum
                     and exhibits received from victims and witnesses. The Commission also sourced
                     materials from the National Archives and from government registries. Secondary
                     materials included the works of academics and reports of relevant organizations
                     and institutions. The Research Department also organized thematic workshops
                     with relevant experts and stakeholders during which various research themes
                     were explored. The investigative functions of the Commission were outlined
                     under section 6 of the TJR Act. In September 2010, the Commission established
                     an Investigation Department with the hiring of two senior investigators. The
                     Commission was unable to hire the head of the department until April 2011. The
                     Commission had resolved, early in its life, that the head of investigations would
                     be a non-Kenyan. However, the ability to attract an international candidate with
                     the requisite skills and experience was dependent on raising funds from donors.
                     For reasons discussed in the next Chapter, this was not possible until April 2011
                     during which month four additional investigators were also recruited.
              
             58.	    The primary role of the Investigations Department was to identify and interview
                     witnesses whose individual stories would contribute to the historical narrative



94           REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION
                                                                                Vol u m e I   Chapter THREE




       of gross violations of human rights in the country. The role of the Department
       also extended to the collection and analysis of relevant documentary and other
       forms of evidence. The strategy for conducting such investigations was robust yet
       flexible enough to adapt to the changing operational environment. For purposes
       of selecting window cases to be heard during the individual hearings (see below),
       the Investigation Department interviewed a total of 919 people across the country
       as shown in the table below.

Phases of investigations
59.	   Investigations were conducted in three main phases: before, during and after the
       hearings.

       	   Pre-hearing investigations: Pre-hearing investigations were conducted
            ahead of the hearings in each of the eight provinces of the country. A senior
            investigator appointed as the Investigations Manager for each region was
            responsible for developing a Regional Investigation Plan. The Plan consisted
            of an overview of the major human rights violations reported in the region. It
            also included a list of potential witnesses and AMPs distilled from Statement
            Forms and from other sources of information available to the Commission. A
            Regional Report was then produced identifying crucial cases to be investigated
            in a specific region and a timeline for conducting the investigations.

       	    An investigation team was then deployed to the regions and with the help
            of the Regional Office, located witnesses and obtained detailed statements
            from them, which were then verified and corroborated by other evidence.
            Visible evidence of injuries sustained by witnesses was documented through
            photography. Where possible and in appropriate cases, the investigation
            team visited the sites of violations and took photographs to document the
            scene. They also searched for and collected documents and secured relevant
            physical evidence.

       	    The Investigation Manager for each region produced a daily report which
            included summaries of the interviews conducted, documentary evidence
            collected, signed copies of the formal statements and details of any other
            investigative activity. These daily reports were the foundation of the final
            Regional Investigation Reports that were developed at the conclusion of each
            regional pre-hearing investigation.

       	   Investigations during hearings: Investigations during hearings were
            conducted by an investigator who was present at a hearing session. This
            investigator assessed, with the help of the Regional Coordinator, new
            witnesses and took further detailed statements when appropriate. He also



                             REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION                 95
Volume I   Chapter THREE




                           conducted immediate investigative follow-up of issues emanating from the
                           hearings.

                     	    Post-hearing investigations: Although each regional hearing was conducted
                           and concluded in a short span of time ranging from two to six weeks, Regional
                           Coordinators continued their field inquiries and were approached by witnesses
                           wishing to provide information. This led to identification of further issues for
                           investigation and investigators accordingly returned to some areas to conduct
                           further inquiries even after the conclusion of hearings. These additional field
                           trips were considered on a case by case basis. The new information collected
                           was integrated into the regional investigation reports.
              
             60.	    The Investigations Department also continued to work in support of the Nairobi-
                     based thematic hearings. Additionally, investigators played a significant role in
                     the identification and collection of information in relation to adversely mentioned
                     persons.


             Hearings
             61.	    Section 5(a) and (b) of the TJR Act required the Commission to establish an
                     accurate, complete and historical record of gross human rights violations and
                     to gather as much information as possible about the causes, nature and extent
                     of these violations. Together with research, investigations and other sources of
                     information, hearings enabled the Commission to fulfil a major part of this duty.

             62.	    The Commission started its hearings in mid-April 2011 in Garissa and concluded at
                     the beginning of April 2012 in Nairobi. The Commission conducted three kinds of
                     hearings: individual hearings, women’s hearings and thematic hearings.

             Individual Hearings
             63.	    Individual hearings focused on the experience of individuals in relation to gross
                     violation of human rights. Testimony was heard from individuals whose rights had
                     been violated, as well as from those who either had knowledge of or allegedly
                     participated in acts that resulted in the violations. The individual hearings were
                     designed to achieve three goals, namely:

                     	    To provide victims, adversely mentioned persons and the general public with
                           a platform for non-retributive truth telling;

                     	    To provide victims with a forum to be heard and restore their dignity; and




96           REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION
                                                                                   Vol u m e I   Chapter THREE




       	   To provide repentant adversely mentioned persons with a forum to confess
            their actions as a way of bringing reconciliation.
 
64.	   To a large extent the first two objectives, specifically as they related to victims,
       were achieved. As is described elsewhere in this Report, many of the victims who
       narrated their experiences at the Commission’s hearings did so for the very first
       time. For them, the forum and platform provided by the Commission had a healing
       or therapeutic effect; and the simple act of speaking out was a big stride towards
       emotional recovery and restoration of human dignity.

65.	   However, only limited success was recorded in respect to the third objective. A number
       of adversely mentioned persons who appeared before the Commission claimed that
       they had forgotten details of the events under scrutiny or simply took a defensive
       position. They were not forthright with details. Some were unapologetic about their
       role regarding specific events especially security operations that culminated in the
       massacre of innocent individuals. Others offered apologies, but such apologies were
       usually not combined with any acknowledgement of responsibility.

66.	   Individual hearings were designed on the basis of a few cases (‘window cases’)
       that were selected for purposes of painting the broader patterns and trends of
       gross violations of human rights in a particular region or area.
 



                             REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION                    97
Volume I   Chapter THREE




             Selection of Window Cases
             67.	 Due to the large number of statements and memoranda received by the
                  Commission, it was impossible to provide a public platform for all individuals who
                  wished to testify. Only a small percentage of victims were given the opportunity
                  to testify. The statement by Commissioner Margaret Shava in response to a
                  witness who sought to know the relevance of his testimony summarises the
                  rationale of using window cases:7
                           We have gone out and asked people who feel that they would like to make a statement
                           to the Commission to make a statement. We have collected over 40,000 statements
                           but we cannot hear 40,000 people because of the time that we have been given to do
                           our work. So we have selected some cases that we feel bring out the nature and the
                           patterns of violations which have taken place in this country. We feel that your stories
                           demonstrate a very important aspect and that is why we have asked you to come […]
                           We hope that by the time we have heard your story, we will gain an understanding
                           that we did not have about how these violations have been perpetrated. That
                           understanding is going to inform our findings and recommendations in our report.

             68.	    Or as Commissioner Tecla Namachanja explained in Mandera in April 2011:
                           Let me also take this opportunity to thank those who recorded statements with the
                           Commission. In total, the Commission received over 30,000 statements and 300 memoranda.
                           Because of time limitation and the nature of Truth Commissions, we shall not be able to
                           conduct hearings for all the statements recorded. The Commission has, therefore, selected
                           a few statements to conduct the hearings on what would give a global picture of the
                           violations suffered by people from this region. In the next three days, for example, we shall
                           hear testimonies on the history of events and violations in Mandera; violations suffered
                           by women, testimonies on torture, marginalization, massacres, extrajudicial killings,
                           detentions, loss of property, serious injuries suffered during postelection violence and
                           police brutality. Although a few people will be giving testimonies concerning violations
                           suffered in Mandera, most of you will relate with the testimonies shared because most of
                           you have suffered similar violations. However, I want to assure you that every statement
                           recorded will be part of the report when the Commission finishes its work.8

             69.	    To ensure that a representative sample of cases was selected in each region, the
                     selection process considered the following factors:
                      	    regional trends and patterns of gross violation of human rights;
                      	    issues and injustices specific to the region;

                      	    issues and injustices specific to vulnerable and minority groups resident in the
                            region;

98           REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION
                                                                                 Vol u m e I   Chapter THREE




       	   significant events that occurred in the region during the mandate period, such
            as security operations
 
70.	   Three departments – Legal, Investigations and Research – were involved in the
       selection of cases. The Research Department prepared, for each region, a general
       background report describing the regional trends and patterns of human
       rights violations. The Investigations Department searched through statements
       and memoranda in the regional reports for potential window cases. This was
       followed by the interviewing of potential witnesses and narrowing down their
       number and findings submitted to the legal department. The Legal Department
       assessed the cases further and depending on the suitability of a case prepared a
       final list of window cases.

71.	   Regional Coordinators and Statement Takers were also invaluable actors in the
       process because of their knowledge of their respective regions and the issues
       most important to the local community. The Commission also profiled events and
       violations thought to have particular relevance to the national narrative about
       gross violations of human rights.

Preparation of Witnesses
72.	   The Special Support Services Department was responsible for preparing witnesses
       for hearings. This involved counselling witnesses and managing their expectations.
       In partnership with a number of organisations including Kenya Red Cross Society,
       Kenyatta National Hospital and the Gender Violence Recovery Centre, counselling
       services were provided. The Kenya Counselling Association and the Kenya Institute
       of Professional Counsellors assisted the Commission to identify locally based
       counsellors who would continue offering counselling services to witnesses and
       victims long after the Commission had concluded its hearings in a specific area or
       region. 
 
73.	   All witnesses were encouraged to come to the hearings with a relative, friend or a
       person they trusted and who could provide emotional support as they gave their
       testimony. All witnesses who had to travel a long distance to the hearing venue had
       their travel expenses met, and were provided with a modest stipend to cover their
       living expenses while participating in the hearings. The Commission also ensured
       that female witnesses with infants were able to attend the hearings and travelled
       with someone to look after their infants at the expense of the Commission.
 
74.	   At least a day before the hearing, witnesses were shown the hearing venue
       to give them a chance to familiarise themselves with the hearing setting and
       ask any questions they had about the process. On the day of the hearing, the

Volume I   Chapter THREE




                     Commission explained to witnesses the hearing procedures and the role of the
                     various actors.

             Conducting Individual Hearings
             75.	    The conduct of the hearings was governed by the Hearing Procedure Rules which
                     were published in the Kenya Gazette on 8 April 2011.9 These rules were produced
                     after extensive consultations with law-oriented stakeholders, including the Law
                     Society of Kenya, International Federation of Women Lawyers (FIDA-Kenya) and
                     the Kenya Section of the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ-Kenya). 

             76.	    Often, public hearings began with the testimonies of community leaders who did
                     not necessarily testify about specific violations but rather about the general issues
                     affecting their particular community, area or region and the broader context of
                     violations within that particular area or region.
              
             77.	    The Commission was established as a quasi-judicial body and its ultimate goal
                     was to find the truth and foster reconciliation. As such, its hearings were non-
                     adversarial in nature. Under the guidance of a Leader of Evidence, witnesses
                     were allowed to tell their stories in their own words and style and with minimum
                     interruption. Only at the end of a testimony would the Leader of Evidence and
                     the Commissioners pose questions to a witness in order to clarify or seek views
                     on specific aspects covered in the testimony. 
              
             78.	    The Commission ensured that witnesses restricted their testimony to what they
                     had recorded in their written statements, especially those aspects relating to
                     adversely mentioned persons. The witnesses were instructed not to adversely
                     mention individuals whom they had not already recorded in their statements.
                     This allowed the Commission the opportunity in accordance with the rules
                     of natural justice to notify individuals in advance if they were to be adversely
                     mentioned. 

              79.	 All adversely mentioned persons were invited before the Commission and were
                   informed of their statutory right to be represented by legal counsel. However,
                   in accordance with the gazetted Hearing Rules, neither they nor their legal
                   representatives were permitted to cross-examine witnesses. They were invited to
                   listen to the testimony of witnesses and later given an opportunity to tell their
                   version of the story. The idea was to ensure that the Commission’s proceedings
                   were not transformed into a rigid, adversarial court-like scenario in which
                   witnesses could not express themselves fully and freely.

                                  TJRC public hearings at Bungoma County Hall.




80.	   In evaluating the testimony and evidence presented at such hearings where
       adverse testimony was given against individuals or institutions, the Commission
       took into account the fact that these individuals and their counsel were prevented
       from cross-examining witnesses. In this regard Commission hearings borrowed
       from the traditions of civil law legal systems where the decision-maker plays a
       more active role in examining and cross-examining witnesses than is the case in
       common law legal systems. 

81.	   The hearings were conducted by a panel of at least three or more Commissioners,
       one of whom had to be an international Commissioner, and one of whom had to
       be of the opposite gender from the other two. As a general policy, the Commission
       endeavoured to make sure that that at least one international Commissioner was
       present at all formal proceedings of the Commission. The involvement of foreign
       Commissioners expanded the pool of expertise. It was also the Commission’s
       experience that victims in some parts of the country were more receptive to
       foreign Commissioners than to their Kenyan counterparts. For instance, when
       asked of his expectations of the Commission, a witness in Mandera responded:

                           Initially, I did not have any expectation. There was rape and killing. This was normal. I
                           now see that there is a Commission which has the intention of doing justice. Now there
                           is a ray of hope in my heart. I expect justice. When I see international faces amongst you
                           people, I get a glimpse of hope that we may find justice for the rape and the killings that
                           took place. I pray that justice prevails and the criminals be brought to book.10

             82.	 The Commission selected venues for the hearings taking into account the
                  following considerations:
                      	    capacity of the venue ;
                      	    accessibility of the venue to witnesses and the general public including by
                            persons with disabilities;
                      	    neutrality of the venue, especially in regions or areas where two or more
                            groups or communities with a history of conflict or tension reside;
                      	    availability of sanitary services and other social amenities; and
                      	    security.
              
             83.	    The Commission held hearings in several locations in each region in an effort to
                     facilitate public access and participation and to ensure that diverse voices were
                     heard. Simultaneous translation of the proceedings was provided at all public
                     hearings including into sign language.
              
             84.	    The majority of witnesses who testified before the Commission did so in public.
                     However, where the safety of a witness or the nature of his/her testimony so
                     demanded, the hearing was held in private.

102          REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION
                                                                                                          Vol u m e I     Chapter THREE




Women’s Hearings
85.	    The participation of women and members of other vulnerable groups is a central
        pillar of any comprehensive and inclusive truth-seeking process. Experience
        has shown that due to gender stereotypes and cultural norms, women are
        unlikely to participate in public processes unless proactive measures are taken
        to encourage and facilitate such participation. In the absence of such measures
        in the past, Kenyan women had traditionally been left out of public processes
        that had shaped and defined the country’s socio-political and economic policies
        including those policies that directly impacted their day to day lives. 

86.	    Not surprisingly, the participation of women in public hearings conducted by
        the Makau Mutua Task Force to gather views as to whether Kenyans desired a
        truth commission was limited. Therefore, the Task Force made the following
        observation, suggesting as it did, that a truth commission established in
        accordance with its recommendations should pay particular attention to the
        participation of women in its processes:11 

             The Task Force was deeply concerned by the low numbers of women who turned up
             at its public hearings to make submissions. Although the Task Force encouraged the
             few women present to speak up, this problem will have to be addressed once the truth
             commission is set up so that the issues that are particular to women are adequately
             dealt with. Kenya, like most countries, has deeply embedded prejudices, policies,
             and traditions that have historically marginalised women and made them invisible
             in the public square. Discrimination against women, violence, rape, and patriarchy
             have consigned women to the margins of society. Human rights violations and the
             economic crimes committed by the state have a special gendered effect on women.
             That is why violations against women have disproportionately multiplied adverse
             effects and are rarely addressed. A truth commission must pay particular attention
             to the participation of women and the abuses perpetrated against them. Otherwise,
             a truth commission will have little or no beneficial value in addressing the plight of
             women.
 
87.	    Against this background, the Commission took measures to ensure the participation
        of women in its processes including in the hearings. Indeed, section 27(1) of the
        TJR Act permitted the Commission to put in place special arrangements and adopt
        specific mechanisms and procedures to address the experiences of, amongst
        others, women.

Volume I   Chapter THREE




             88.	    In particular, the Commission conducted, alongside its public hearings, women-
                     specific hearings which were exclusively attended by women. The Commission
                     was conscious of the fact that while some women were courageous enough to
                     testify about traumatic events in front of a general public hearing, restricting
                     women to these general public hearings only would have resulted in many
                     women being reluctant to testify. Moreover, the decision to conduct women-
                     focused hearings was reinforced when a preliminary review at the conclusion of
                     the statement-taking process showed that only one third of the total statements
                     received were from women. In essence, women had not come forward to record
                     statements in numbers proportionate to their representation in the general
                     population.
              
             89.	    The hearings were framed as ‘conversations with women’. They were designed
                     to and were safe spaces where women could freely talk about violations that
                     were specific to them. The majority of women who attended the hearings felt
                     comfortable sharing their most traumatic memories. The women’s hearings
                     enabled the Commission to fill the gap identified in its data bank as well as
                     to record violations specific to women. The hearings provided insights into
                     women’s perspectives of experiencing injustice and conflict. They also provided
                     the Commission with insights into women’s views as to how they wanted their
                     suffering and pain redressed.

             90.	    The Commission was, however, concerned that while the women’s hearings
                     provided a safe space for women to tell their stories, the stories were therefore
                     not heard by men or the general public.  Women hearings were justifiable for the
                     reasons suggested, but an opportunity was lost to reach out and educate men.
                     Some of the men may have been insensitive to or ignorant of the experiences
                     of women, including the impact of historical injustices. 

             91.	    But on a balance, the Commission’s choice of holding women-only hearings
                     was clearly the correct choice.  Without the hearings the experience of the
                     vast majority of women who engaged with the Commission would not have
                     been captured.  It is hoped that the inclusion of a detailed discussion in this
                     Report of what was learned from those hearings will increase the awareness of
                     men about the impact of injustices on women, and thus counter the adverse
                     impacts of the exclusion of men from these hearings.

             Conducting Women’s Hearings
             92.	    Women’s Hearings were presided over by female Commissioners and female staff
                     of the Commission. The proceedings of the hearing were recorded verbatim.
                     Translation services were provided to allow participants to freely communicate
                     in the language of their choice. Prior to the hearings and with the financial
                     support of UN Women, civic education was conducted to create awareness
                     about the hearings amongst women and to encourage their participation.
                     Women were encouraged to attend and participate in the hearings through
                     announcements at local markets, and local radio stations. Leaders of community
                     based organizations encouraged women to attend and to participate.

             93.	    Counsellors using group sessions prepared women to give their testimonies
                     prior to the start of hearings. They were informed of what to expect during the
                     hearing and reassured of the confidentiality of the process. Before the start of the
                     hearings they were invited to perform songs and dances. The Commissioners and
                     staff of the Commission always joined in the singing and dancing, a gesture that
                     fostered confidence and trust among the women and created an atmosphere
                     conducive for the candid and open conversations that ensued.
              
             94.	    The hearings were conducted in all regions of the country and were attended
                     by more than 1000 women with an average of 60 women in each hearing. The
                     majority of the women expressed appreciation for the opportunity to speak about
                     issues that they had hitherto not spoken about in public and in some cases, had
                     not even spoken about in private.



           Box 1

              Comments by an independent observer regarding women’s hearing held in Garissa
             I informally write to commend, congratulate you and encourage you to continue doing a
             great job as you have been doing at the public hearings and as very well demonstrated this
             morning with the women's private hearings.

             Kindly allow me to briefly share my experience today with you on two particular areas I
             observed: managing of the day's women's hearing and strong concluding remarks.

             You are conducting a laborious task for and on behalf of Kenyans, and we appreciate your
             tireless  efforts and great commitment to deliver on this task under [an] immensely busy
             schedule.

Today, you two [Commissioner Tecla Namachanja and Secretary Patricia Nyaundi], supported
by your team, really managed the hearings well, and demonstrated very high level [of ]
cultural and emotional intelligence. You connected with the women participants very well in
the morning session, and set the mood and atmosphere right for the women to openly share
and narrate their experiences,
I wish to commend you, [firstly], on how you managed the hearings. I observed the following
positive things]
i) 	 Letting the women sing and dance to their favourite choice songs at the beginning (and
     also at the end), let them psychologically relax and start bonding as  the women-folk
     gathered for the same agenda.
ii) 	 Emphasis on the importance and significance of the hearings for the individual and the
      group, and that each participant narrating their story should be heard with equal respect
      and attention and by reprimanding the participants laughing at another's story. 
iii) 	Your empathy with each of the participants who narrated their story (even when the
      events narrated were very  emotionally difficult or disturbing), and acknowledging and
      letting them enlighten TJRC on their own cultural practices on how to handle certain
      experiences.
iv)  giving each one the opportunity to give their own opinion of what is the best
     recommendation that they would contribute to TJRC.
Secondly, the other notable observations to which I wish to extend my compliments, was in
your very strong closing remarks.
i) 	 Helping the women understand the TJRC process and timeframe so as not to raise high
     expectations by giving the assurance that the recommendations and actions will not be
     immediate, but will be included in the TJRC final report, which will also take time and will
     come at the end of the process of public hearings around the country 
ii)	 Explaining that  healing in the period after the TJRC is equally important and must
     continue; by inviting the women to continue [the process] amongst themselves [by] telling
     or narrating their traumatic stories in an environment where they can be comfortably
     vulnerable enough to allow for the healing process and with the support of CBOs and
     NGOs, [and to] even write these stories for record.
iii)	[The] gesture of  friendship and willingness  to continue engaging with public by
     encouraging those women who did not have a chance to record their statements or have
     a memorandum written to do so and leaving a token (TJRC 'kikoy') of appreciation for
     participants for taking time to support TJRC.
I apologize for the long email, but having only  previously experienced the mock hearings
and then  Isiolo hearings, I could not resist applauding you and the entire TJRC team-
Commissioners and Staff for working tirelessly to make the hearings a success.
The journey continues, but be encouraged that TJRC will only do it better!

             Referral Mechanisms
             95.	    There were high expectations among victims in almost all places that the Commission
                     visited that the Commission would at the very least meet their immediate needs
                     both in monetary or material terms. This was outside the direct mandate of the
                     Commission. Furthermore, the Commission did not have resources beyond what
                     was allocated for providing transport and accommodation to victims who testified.

             96.	    As a stopgap measure the Commission established a referral mechanism. Thus,
                     where women raised issues which could be redressed immediately by a specific
                     government department or ministry or organisation, they were referred to these
                     institutions and also advised on how to access them. For example, women with
                     disabilities were referred to the National Council for Persons with Disabilities
                     where they were registered and found information on how to access the National
                     Development Fund for Persons with Disability.
              
             97.	    Women seeking to access credit were referred to the Women’s Enterprise Fund
                     while those with matters relating to child maintenance were referred to the
                     Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Development. Others were referred to civil
                     society organisations for pro bono legal services amongst other services.

             98.	    In a few instances, the Commission in collaboration with organisations such as
                     the Jaipur Foot Project provided direct support. This included the provision of
                     wheelchairs and white canes for witnesses with disability. Similarly, women who
                     were found to be suffering from prolonged post traumatic stress disorder were
                     provided with treatment as part of a project funded by AMREF and implemented
                     in conjunction with the Kenyatta National Hospital and local district hospitals.

             Monitoring and Evaluation of Hearings
             99.	    The hearings were evaluated by independent monitors who submitted periodic
                     reports to the Commission pointing out both the strengths and weaknesses of
                     the exercise. ICJ Kenya Chapter, Kituo cha Sheria, and KNCHR were among the
                     organisations who formally conducted the exercise. The evaluations of these
                     institutions were based on observations of the Commission’s hearings and
                     interviews of relevant stakeholders including Commissioners and staff of the
                     Commission.

             100.	 The Commission received and proceeded to make appropriate changes where
                   it was feasible to do so. ICJ Kenya presented to the Commission what may be
                   regarded as the most comprehensive evaluation of the Commission’s hearings.

      The evaluation report identified a number of positive aspects about the manner
      in which the Commission conducted hearings. The report concluded that the
      hearings complied with international standards for truth seeking bodies and in
      particular:

       	   due process protections were afforded to individuals who testified before the
            Commission;

       	   persons of interest to the Commission were treated with respect and dignity;

       	   persons of interest were provided with the opportunity to give a statement to
            the Commission laying forth their version of the events in question;

       	   the Commission made attempts to corroborate information implicating
            individuals before they were publicly named as persons of interest;

       	   the hearings focused on securing recognition of truths that were formerly
            denied or hidden, such as the Wagalla Massacre.

101.	 The evaluation report also raised a number of concerns including that: the
      hearings were legalistic and court-like; the extent of victim participation in
      the planning and conduct of the hearings was unclear; information about the
      Commission’s resources and procedures for provision of psychosocial support
      were not widely and publicly available; and that the Commission’s dissemination
      of information relating to hearings fell below expectation.

102.	 The Commission did not take these concerns lightly and took appropriate remedial
      measures. Noting that most of the issues revolved around information sharing, the
      Commission launched a new website on 26 August 2011. The website offered a
      fresh look with enhanced user-friendly navigation which in turn facilitated faster
      access to information. Some of the features that were introduced in the new
      website included the following:

       	   Latest News: This feature provided highlights of latest news on what is
            happening at the Commission. This included the Commission’s official
            communication to the public.

       	   What's New: This feature provided an all inclusive list of the latest additions
            to the website.

       	   Events Calendar: This feature provided details of events such as hearings,
            workshops, civic education and outreach programs as well as other relevant
            activities.

                           to easily search and find information on the website.

                     	    Media Centre: the Media Centre contained news, press releases and
                           information relating to the Commission’s coverage in the media.


             Post-Hearing Feedback Sessions 	
             103.	 Due to time constraints, the Commission was unable to hear testimonies of
                   adversely mentioned persons in the specific areas or regions in which they had
                   been adversely mentioned. Although some AMPs were heard in the regions, most
                   hearings for AMPS were held in Nairobi a few weeks after the individual hearings
                   had been concluded in the regions. Therefore, the majority of victims did not
                   have the opportunity to be present at the hearings in which AMPs testified or
                   gave their version of the story.
              
             104.	 In mitigation against the inability of victims to witness the testimonies of AMPs,
                   the Commission, in partnership with Kenya National Commission on Human Rights
                   (KNCHR) and German Technical Cooperation (GIZ), organised thirteen public
                   feedback meetings in Wajir and Garissa counties in October 2011. The initial plan
                   also included sessions in Mandera County. However, due to security reasons those
                   sessions were cancelled. Subsequent to its hearings in Mandera, which borders
                   Somalia, activities by the Al Shabaab militia group heightened, making the
                   Commission’s travel to Mandera impossible for security reasons.

                                                                                     Vol u m e I   Chapter THREE




105.	 The feedback sessions involved showing a video summarising individual and
      women’s hearings in the Northern region of Kenya and another video showing
      proceedings of the AMP hearings in Nairobi. The sessions began with a moderator
      explaining the Commission’s mandate and process, including what would
      possibly happen to AMPs (for example, the possibility that they would be named
      in this Report or recommendation made for their prosecution). After viewing the
      two videos, a public dialogue designed to get feedback from the audience and
      to answer questions followed.
 
106.	 Attendance at the sessions in Wajir County was high with audiences ranging from
      150 to 300 people (Women constituted between 20% and 50% of the audience). In
      Garissa County, the attendance was much lower, with audiences between 15 and
      35 people, with women constituting 20% of the audience.
 
107.	 The Commission had intended to organise similar feedback sessions in all
      regions in the country but this could not be done because of time and financial
      constraints.
 
Media Coverage of Public Hearings
108.	 The success of a truth commission partly depends on a nation’s awareness and level
      of its peoples’ participation in its processes. The media plays a central role given
      its ability and capacity to reach out to the masses. For this reason, and bearing in
      mind the dynamic and positive contribution the media had made in the success of,
      for instance, the South African Truth Commission, the Makau Mutua Task Force had
      envisaged a Kenyan truth commission whose public hearings would be carried
      live on television and radio.12 Indeed, there were some at the Task Force who were
      of the opinion that the public broadcaster, Kenya Broadcasting Television (KBC),
      would be expressly required to carry the public hearings of the truth commission
      live on radio and television.13

109.	 However, the experience of the Commission was very different from what had been
      envisaged and strongly advocated for. The Commission’s public hearings were
      carried live on television on only two occasions. This led to an analyst to lament,
      justifiably so, that:
            As victims and affected communities engage in the public hearings, what seems to
            be lacking is a national dialogue and engagement in the truth-seeking process. Most

Volume I   Chapter THREE




                           notable in this regard is the low media coverage of the proceedings. This is most
                           aptly demonstrated through a comparison between the media coverage of the public
                           hearings (and the TJRC process in general) and past national truth-recovery processes.
                           For instance, the Goldenberg Inquiry into embezzlement of public funds elicited great
                           public participation and was intensely covered in the media including through daily
                           live broadcasts of the Commission’s proceedings in one of the main television stations.
                           Given the gravity of the past atrocities that form the subject of the TJRC hearings, one
                           would imagine that there would be significant public interest in and robust media
                           coverage of the hearings.14

             101.	 There were several reasons that accounted for this state of affairs. Firstly,
                   throughout the period that the Commission held its public hearings, it constantly
                   competed for news coverage with more dramatic and unfolding events such as
                   those surrounding the International Criminal Court. Secondly, due to its lean
                   budget, the Commission could not afford to pay for live coverage of its hearings.
                   The media houses, on their part, did not appear to consider the Commission’s
                   hearings worthy or suitable for unpaid-for coverage in the public interest. In
                   other words, in a commercialized media environment as obtains in Kenya, it is
                   in the nature of media houses to amplify mostly that which in their opinion sells
                   newspapers or draws audiences.

             111.	 Since it could not afford to pay for live coverage of its hearings, the Commission
                   opted to carry weekly roundups of its hearings in a documentary format. Even so,
                   finding a suitable television channel to carry the weekly round-up was not easy.
                   Citizen TV could not slot the Commission’s round-up at prime time but offered
                   only to do so on Saturdays and Sundays in the afternoon. This arrangement did
                   not work for long for it was still expensive. The Commission, therefore, moved its
                   round-up to the public broadcaster where the round-ups were transmitted every
                   Wednesday’s after the 9 p.m. news at a fee.

             112.	 However, the Commission’s experience with the public broadcaster, in one
                   occasion, was reminiscent of the old days during which the public broadcaster
                   was under the control of the state. In particular, KBC failed to air the Commission’s
                   round-up on 5 October 2011 without notice. In response to the Commission’s
                   demand for an explanation, KBC’s Managing Director, Chris Mutungi, wrote that
                   the round-up scheduled for that day ‘was found unsuitable for transmission
                   based on KBC’s editorial programming policy’. The said policy, however, is neither
                   in the public sphere nor was it expounded upon. It appears that the round-up
                   was censored because a witness appearing in that round-up had mentioned

             Thematic Hearings
             113.	 In addition to individual hearings, the Commission conducted thematic hearings
                   that focused on specific violations, events, or groups of victims. Thematic hearings
                   were meant to elicit public testimony on specific themes that are of particular
                   importance in Kenya’s pursuit for truth, justice and reconciliation.

             114.	 The Commission held a total of 14 thematic hearings focusing on the following
                   subjects:

                     	    Access to justice;

                     	    Economic marginalisation and minorities;

                     	    Land;
                     	    Armed militia groups;
                     	    Prisons and detention centres;
                     	    Torture;
                     	    Ethnic tensions and violence;
                     	    The 1982 attempted coup;

                     	    Security agencies, extra-judicial killings and massacres;
                     	    Persons with disabilities (PWDs);
                     	    Women;
                     	    Children;
                     	    Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs); and
                     	    Political assassinations.

             105.	 In selecting the subject of the hearings, weight was given to significant events
                   during the mandate period and to highlighting the experiences of particularly
                   vulnerable groups with respect to historical injustices.

             116.	 Individual experts, associations representing groups of victims, and relevant CSOs
                   and state agencies were invited to testify during these hearings. The Commission
                   held preparatory consultation sessions with relevant stakeholders prior to some of
                   the thematic hearings. In a number of the hearings such as those on children, IDPs
                   and PWDs, individual victims of violations were also invited to testify.

Media Workshop
117.	 The Commission also held a media workshop on 23 February 2012. This workshop
      was similar to a thematic hearing. It brought together journalists, media houses
      and associations representing journalists and media houses. They testified about
      their experiences relating to state control and repression of the media during the
      mandate period.

Thematic Hearing on Children
118.	 The thematic hearing on children was based on statements recorded by children
      and was designed to ensure that children gave their testimony in an environment
      in which they felt safe, free and confident to do so. The Commission took several
      measures towards this end.
 
119.	 Although the hearing was open to the public, the identities of children who testified
      were concealed. Members of the public could follow the hearing by a video link
      but could not see the particular child testifying before the Commission. Moreover,
      the children were not identified by their names or in any other identifiable way.
      Secondly, the hearing venue was set up such that the Commissioners sat at the
      same level as the children testifying before them. Play and art materials were
      available in the hearing venue to allow the children to play and/or paint even as

Volume I   Chapter THREE




                     they testified. As was the case with the general individual hearings, children and
                     their care givers visited the hearing venue on the eve of the hearing. Similarly, each
                     child who testified received counselling before and after sessions.
              
             120.	 Each child testified for an average of 20 minutes, although the time varied
                   depending on the age of the child. A total of 40 children, aged between 6 and 17
                   years, from across the country, attended the thematic hearing which was held in
                   Nairobi with the Commission paying for the transport of both the children and
                   their parents or caregivers, to and from Nairobi.
              
             Televised Discussions on Thematic Hearings
             121.	 In January 2012, the Commission produced a series of 30 minute discussion
                   programmes based on the subjects covered during the Commission’s thematic
                   hearings which were televised on KTN. The programme entitled ‘Kenya’s Unheard
                   Truth’ was launched on 9 February 2012. It was broadcast at 10 p.m. every Thursday.
                   A total of eight programmes were aired between February and April 2012.


             Focus Group Discussions
             122.	 The Commission undertook a special data collection exercise on regional perceptions
                   about the violations of socio-economic rights and economic marginalisation. This
                   special exercise was needed after preliminary analysis of statements and memoranda
                   showed that reporting on the violations of socio-economic rights was very low. Despite
                   the fact that the Statement Form had a dedicated section on socio-economic rights,
                   individuals who recorded statements tended to focus on human rights violations
                   relating to bodily integrity and less on violations of socio-economic rights.
              
             123.	 Between 25 January 2012 and 8 February 2012, the Commission conducted Focus
                   Group Discussions (FGDs) throughout the country with a view to documenting
                   regional perceptions on violations of socio-economic rights and on economic
                   marginalisation. This was done to supplement data collected through statement
                   taking.

             124.	 For these discussions, the Commission drafted a questionnaire for guidance.15 The
                   questionnaire was reviewed both internally and externally before it was pre-tested
                   in Kibera, Nairobi, on 14 December 2011 and revised accordingly to incorporate
                   insights gained from the pre-testing exercise.

             15	 See Appendix 7 for the FGD Questionnaire.

125.	 The Commission recruited eight facilitators (one in each province) to conduct the
      FGDs. The facilitators were trained on the mandate of the Commission and the
      use of the questionnaire before being deployed to the provinces to facilitate the
      discussions. Each FGD consisted of about 12 to 15 participants drawn from either
      urban informal settlements or rural areas, although the number of participants
      in exceptional circumstances exceeded 15. Participants were carefully chosen to
      ensure there was diversity in the group in terms of age and gender.  Persons with
      disability and members of other vulnerable groups were particularly targeted
      for inclusion in the discussion group. A total of 81 FGD sessions were conducted
      across the country with a total 1192 individuals participating in the FGDs (See
      table below).

             Site Visits
             126.	 The Commission visited a number of sites of importance to its work in several parts
                   of the country. These visits enabled the Commission to visualize and contextualize
                   violations that had occurred in those sites. Among the sites that the Commission
                   visited include:

                     	    a mass grave in Turbi, Marsabit, where eight adults and 21 children were
                           buried after the Turbi Massacre of 12 July 2005.

                     	    a mass grave in Garbatulla, where individuals killed during the Shifta War were
                           buried.

                     	    a mass grave in Kiambaa KAG Church, Eldoret, where 26 people who were
                           burnt to death at the church during the 2007/2008 Post Election were buried.

                     	    Kiryandongo Refugee Camp in Uganda which hosts Kenyan refugees, primarily
                           from Malaba and surrounding areas, who fled the country during the 2007-
                           2008 Post-Election Violence.

                     	    Wagalla Airstrip, the site of what became the Wagalla Massacre. It is here in
                           February 1984 that men belonging to the Degodia clan were gathered, tortured,
                           and some of them ultimately killed by state security agencies.

127.	 Other sites or places visited by the Commission include Langata Women’s Prison,
      Nyayo House ‘Torture Chambers’ in Nairobi, Mandera Prisons, Mandera Law Courts,
      Mawingu IDP Camp in Naivasha, and Kapkota Military Base in Mt. Elgon.



Reconciliation
128.	 The Commission’s reconciliation activities were spearheaded, at the Commissioners’
      level, by the Reconciliation Committee established in terms of section 22 of the TJR
      Act, and at the Secretariat level, by the Department of Civic Education and Outreach.

Reconciliation Policy
129.	 Reconciliation activities were conducted under the Reconciliation Policy which laid
      out the Commission’s understanding of the notion of reconciliation and its role. In
      particular, the following policy guidelines guided the Commission’s reconciliation
      work:

       	   Reconciliation is complex and includes several relationships, levels and actors.
            The various levels or ‘types’ of reconciliation include intra-personal, inter-
            personal, inter-community, and national reconciliation.

       	   In a context where inter-ethnic tension is deep, as is the case in Kenya, the
            mending of social relations is imperative. The role of the Commission in this
            regard is to facilitate dialogue and other activities that mark the beginning of
            inter-community reconciliation.

       	   Healing is closely linked to reconciliation. The idea of healing invokes the
            idea of remedy, restoration, repair, or mending. National healing entails
            attending to and restoring social relations in communities and inter-ethnic
            relations. At a personal level, healing takes various dimensions, but begins
            with acknowledgement and restoration of dignity.

       	   Reconciliation is both a goal and a process. As a goal, it is a long term goal. The
            Commission role in this regard is to initiate dialogue and lay the groundwork,
            together with other relevant bodies, for long term processes of reconciliation.
            As a process, reconciliation occurs in various sites and activities. It involves
            numerous actors and the Commission is only one of these.

       	   There exists both conceptual and practical links between reconciliation
            and the notion of justice. Justice includes redistributive, retributive and
            reparative justice. Reconciliation is fostered when those who have suffered




                              REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION                    119
Volume I   Chapter THREE




                           are restored and repaired, those who were previously excluded are included
                           in meaningful ways, and those in dire want as a result of marginalization are
                           materially enabled to move forward.

                     	    A relationship exists, too, between reconciliation and truth. While closure
                           for victims and the ability to address past violations and prevent repetition
                           begins with knowing the truth about past events, truth-telling may open
                           wounds in ways that slow or impede reconciliation and healing especially
                           at a personal level. The challenge is to engage with both without negating
                           either.

                     	    The notion of truth includes at least three versions or types of truth: Personal
                           or narrative truth (personal versions of truth by witnesses, including victims
                           and perpetrators); factual or forensic truth (the product of investigations,
                           verification and corroboration); social truth (the product of dialogue,
                           interaction, discussion and debate; and healing and restorative truth.

                     	    To achieve reconciliation emphasis should be put on facilitating dialogue
                           and creating space for constructive exchange by and around individuals,
                           communities and institutions.


             Reconciliation Activities
             130.	 In preparation for rolling out reconciliation activities and particularly to ensure
                   the participation of relevant stakeholders in such activities, the Commission
                   convened two meetings in March 2011. On 3 March 2011, the Commission held a
                   Consultative Prayer Breakfast with religious leaders in Nairobi. This was followed
                   a week later by a three-day Stakeholders Consultative Workshop in Naivasha.

             131.	 The Commission also initiated working relations with both governmental and
                   non-governmental organisations including with the National Cohesion and
                   Integration Commission (NCIC) and the National Steering Committee on Peace
                   Building and Conflict Management (established within the auspices of the Ministry
                   of State for Provincial Administration and Internal Security). The Commission’s
                   working relationship with the NCIC resulted in the formation of a Joint Taskforce
                   on National Healing and Reconciliation composed of Commissioners and staff
                   from the two commissions. Unfortunately, activities which the Joint Taskforce
                   had planned to carry out never took off.

             132.	 Reconciliation is a long term process and given the Commission’s resource
                   constraints it embarked on developing a National Reconciliation Agenda to serve

                                                                                 Vol u m e I   Chapter THREE




      as a blue-print for reconciliation activities after the winding up of the Commission.
      Two approaches were adopted for this. First, a Reconciliation Consultative
      Meeting was held on 6 February 2012 bringing together stakeholders involved in
      reconciliation work from across the country. The outcome was the establishment of
      a Reconciliation Reference Group that was mandated to work with the Commission
      to develop the Agenda. The Reference Group held several meetings between
      February and May 2012.

133.	 Second, the Commission undertook countrywide forums on the theme of
      reconciliation. The forums served as avenues to: (a) listen and understand the
      meaning of reconciliation for communities in different regions of the country;
      and (b) find out specific issues in each region that bring about tensions, hostility,
      hatred and conflict. The forums also gave communities the opportunity to suggest
      specific options and solutions to problems and issues affecting them. They were
      able to share their dreams about the Kenya they want and to recommend ways of
      promoting healing and reconciliation in their regions and ultimately in the whole
      of Kenya.
 
134.	 From 9 to 20 March 2012, the Commission held a total of 10 reconciliation forums
      around the country. The forums were held in Mombasa, Garissa, Isiolo, Machakos,
      Nyeri, Eldoret, Nakuru, Kakamega, Kisumu and Nairobi. Between December 2012
      and March 2013, the Commission organized a series of workshops on trauma
      healing and strategy formulation. The workshops were held in Cheptais, Eldoret,
      Mombasa, Kilifi, and Kwale. The objectives of these workshops were to: asses
      levels of healing and reconciliation in selected communities; identify local actors
      who could then spearhead trauma healing and reconciliation; and explore local
      mechanisms for healing and reconciliation.




Report Writing
135.	 The final product of the Commission is this Report which was compiled in
      terms of section 5(j) and 48(2) of the TJR Act. These sections essentially tasked
      the Commission to compile a report providing as comprehensive as possible
      an account of its activities and findings together with recommendations on
      measures to prevent the future occurrence of violations.

              Challenges in the Execution
                              of Mandate



Introduction
1.	   The Commission encountered many challenges in the execution of its mandate
      some of which were expected and understandable while others were completely
      unanticipated. This Chapter highlights these challenges in an effort to enlighten
      Kenyans of the environment and conditions under which the Commission
      operated. The Commission believes that candid reporting of these challenges
      could help prevent similar situations in future both in Kenya and elsewhere in the
      world.

2.	   While there were many impediments to the work of the Commission, only four
      major challenges are discussed here: the controversy surrounding the credibility
      and suitability of the Chairperson; financial and other resource constraints; legal
      challenges; and, the lack of sufficient state and political will to support the work
      and implementation of the objectives for which the Commission was established.

3.	   Other challenges generally stemmed from one or more of these four major
      challenges including the disengagement of key stakeholders (notably CSOs and
      donors) from the processes of the Commission.

             Credibility and Suitability of the Chairperson
             4.	      Almost immediately after the inception of the Commission, CSOs and a range of
                      other actors raised concerns over the suitability and credibility of Ambassador
                      Bethuel Kiplagat to serve as the Commission’s Chairperson. In this section, the
                      Commission explains this challenge in detail because of the great impact it had
                      on the operations of the Commission. Indeed, it was the single challenge that
                      threatened the very existence of the Commission.

             The allegations
             5.	      Many critics argued, initially, that the fact that Ambassador Kiplagat had served
                      in powerful positions in the government of President Daniel arap Moi disqualified
                      him from serving on the Commission. The Commission viewed this matter
                      differently, pointing out that the mere fact that Ambassador Kiplagat (or any
                      other Commissioner) had served in a previous government did not and should
                      not automatically disqualify him from serving on the Commission. Given the
                      fact that the ultimate purpose of the Commission was to foster national unity
                      and reconciliation, the Commission felt that it was not only acceptable, but even
                      desirable, to have such an individual or individuals on the Commission. The
                      Commission was not a judicial mechanism, or a purely investigative commission of
                      inquiry, where the general conflict of interest that Ambassador Kiplagat presented
                      as a former member of President Moi’s government would have been of more
                      serious concern.

             6.	      Some of those raising concerns about Ambassador Kiplagat at this initial stage
                      were more specific, asserting that he presented a direct conflict of interest with
                      respect to three issues in the Commission’s mandate: he was a beneficiary of
                      illegal or irregular allocations of land; he was a key witness to the events leading
                      to the murder of the Honourable Dr. Robert Ouko who was at the time of his death
                      Kenya’s Minister of Foreign Affairs; and he was involved in one or more meetings
                      in Wajir related to the planning of the security operation that ended in the Wagalla
                      Massacre.

             7.	      These three allegations were of particular concern to the other Commissioners.
                      The Act required that a Commissioner should not have been ‘involved, implicated,
                      linked or associated with human rights violations of any kind or in any matter
                      which is to be investigated under this Act’.1 The language of the Act was quite
                      broad, prohibiting not just being implicated in or being legally responsible for a
             1	 TJR Act, Section 10(6)(b).




124          REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION
                                                                                     Vol u m e I   Chapter FOUR




       matter within the Commission’s mandate, but also being involved, associated, or
       even linked to such matters.

8.	    At the beginning these allegations were just that, mere allegations. In the first
       six months of the Commission’s existence (from August 2009 to January 2010)
       the Commission received no evidence to substantiate the allegations of the
       three conflicts of interest stated above. Nevertheless significant sections of civil
       society and other actors continued to call for the resignation of Ambassador
       Kiplagat or the disbanding of the Commission. Hostile demonstrations greeted
       the Commission whenever it ventured into the field to perform its core functions.
       Significant sections of civil society refused to work with the Commission, and
       donors – with few exceptions – were unwilling to engage with or support the
       Commission.

9.	    It was not until January 2010 that the Commission received documents from
       civil society supporting their allegations against Ambassador Kiplagat. Even
       then, the documents were not in themselves conclusive with respect to each
       of the allegations, but were sufficient for the Commission to decide on further
       investigation to determine the extent, if any, of Kiplagat’s conflicts of interest with
       respect to the mandate of the Commission.

Ambassador’s Kiplagat’s response
10.	 In response to the documents submitted to the Commission, Ambassador
     Kiplagat met with all the Commissioners and admitted to having bought the plots
     of land that he was alleged to have received illegally or irregularly (including a
     plot mentioned in the Report of the Commission of Inquiry into Illegal/Irregular
     Allocation of Land (Ndung’u Report). However, he insisted that he had followed all
     of the then existing procedures for the acquisition of such land.

11.	   With respect to the death of Dr. Robert Ouko, Ambassador Kiplagat reiterated
       that he was not involved in any plan or plot to assassinate the Minister (and that
       in fact he was personally and professionally shocked and distraught over the
       assassination). Furthermore, he said he had cooperated with each and every
       investigation undertaken to solve that murder. The Commission noted that at no
       time was any allegation made or evidence presented to the Commission alleging
       that Ambassador Kiplagat was responsible in any way for the murder of the
       Minister. Rather, the allegation was that Ambassador Kiplagat was in possession
       of relevant information and that he had been present at certain events that
       might have been related to the assassination of the Minister. It was also alleged

Volume I   Chapter FOUR




                     that he had been found not to have been a cooperative witness during some or
                     all of the investigations into that murder.

             12.	    Over the Wagalla Massacre, Ambassador Kiplagat first stated categorically that he
                     had never been to Wajir in his entire life and thus could not have attended any
                     meeting that may have taken place there related to the Massacre. He noted that at
                     the time of the alleged meetings in Wajir he had just returned from his posting in
                     London as Kenya’s High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, and thus could not
                     have travelled to attend such a meeting.

             13.	    A few weeks later, Ambassador Kiplagat told fellow Commissioners and the public
                     that he ‘could not remember’ if he had ever been to Wajir or not and thus could not
                     recall if he had ever attended a meeting in Wajir. As it later became clear, Ambassador
                     Kiplagat had in fact attended a meeting of the Kenya Intelligence Committee in
                     Wajir on 8 February 1984 less than forty-eight hours before the start of the security
                     operation that resulted in the Wagalla Massacre.

             14.	    The alleged involvement of the Chairperson in these matters and the fact that
                     documentary evidence had been presented to the Commission linking him
                     to three important areas of the Commission’s mandate, created a conflict of
                     interest between him and the Commission. He could not investigate and make
                     findings on issues of which he was a suspect without violating the fundamental
                     principle of justice that a person should not be a judge in his own case. There
                     seemed to be no way in which he could participate in the hearings and other
                     public activities in these three areas without creating the appearance, if not the
                     reality, of improperly influencing the work of the Commission in matters in which
                     he had an interest. His involvement in any way in the Commission’s activities
                     related to these three areas raised serious concern that such involvement would
                     scare witnesses, including victims, from engaging with the Commission. This
                     would irrevocably diminish the effectiveness, integrity and credibility of the
                     Commission.

             15.	    These conflicts of interest presented by Kiplagat, accompanied by demands for
                     his resignation and the dissolution of the Commission, almost completely eroded
                     the ability of the Commission to garner support from the public, civil society and
                     development partners. Development partners and civil society were extremely
                     reluctant to provide support, including in-kind support, for the Commission’s
                     activities because of Kiplagat’s conflicts which exacerbated the Commission’s
                     financial problems (see below) and hindered the implementation of its ambitious
                     work plan developed in the first few months of its existence.




126          REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION
                                                                                 Vol u m e I   Chapter FOUR




Finding a solution
16.	   From January to April 2010 the Commissioners engaged in a series of internal
       discussions regarding the conflicts of interest presented by Kiplagat. He made it
       clear that he would not resign as chairperson. The other Commissioners respected
       his decision. A number of options were discussed, including the creation of
       an external committee of former Truth Commissioners from around the world
       who would evaluate the matter and present their recommendation on the way
       forward. The Commission retained the services of a professional mediator to
       assist the Commissioners in developing a way forward. The Commission was also
       assisted by the Parliamentary Committee on Legal and Administrative Affairs in
       seeking a solution.

17.	   After about three months of discussion, Ambassador Kiplagat indicated that
       he preferred to follow the provisions of the Act concerning the removal of a
       commissioner as set out in Section 17. The Commissioners unanimously agreed
       with the option chosen by Ambassador Kiplagat. On 12 April 2010, all nine
       Commissioners, including Ambassador Kiplagat, wrote to the Minister of Justice
       asking that a formal request be sent to the Chief Justice to establish a tribunal
       pursuant to Section 17 of the Act to enquire into the conflicts of interest raised
       by the presence of Ambassador Kiplagat in the Commission.

18.	   Recognising the detrimental effect this controversy was having on the work of
       the Commission, and recognising further that a legal process had now been
       initiated to address the issues raised by his continued participation and presence
       in the Commission, Ambassador Kiplagat agreed to step aside until the tribunal
       process reached its conclusion. This promise was included in the letter of 12 April
       2010 to the Minister of Justice which was signed by all Commissioners, including
       Ambassador Kiplagat.

19.	   However, within 24 hours of having signed the letter indicating he would step
       aside, Ambassador Kiplagat met Commissioners and stated that he would not in
       fact step aside. He indicated that he had been advised by the Ministry of Justice
       that he could not legally step aside and thus he would not honour the pledge he
       had made in writing the day before. Meanwhile, the Minister of Justice responded
       to the Commission’s letter of 12 April 2010. He advised that given the provisions
       of the Act, the Commission should write directly to the Chief Justice.

20.	   Thus, on 15 April 2010, all eight Commissioners, with the express consent and
       approval of Kiplagat, filed a petition with the Chief Justice requesting a tribunal

Volume I   Chapter FOUR




                     under Section 17 to determine whether Ambassador Kiplagat had engaged in
                     ‘misbehaviour or misconduct’ under Section 17(1)(a) of the Act by:

                          a)	 swearing in an affidavit submitted to the Selection Panel that he was not
                              ‘in any way ... involved, implicated, linked or associated with human rights
                              violations of any kind or in any matter which is to be investigated under the
                              Act’ as provided in Section 10(6)(b) of the Act;

                          b)	 privately and publicly asserting during his time as commissioner that he
                              was not in violation of Section 10(6)(b) of the Act; and

                          c)	 asserting the right to participate in investigations and other related
                              activities with respect to matters in which he has a conflict of interest.

             21.	    After almost a month without a response from the Chief Justice, the Commission
                     wrote to him on 14 May 2010 inquiring as to the status of the petition.

             22.	    On 9 September 2010, in the absence of any decision on the part of the Chief
                     Justice to accept or reject the Commission’s petition, a coalition of civil society
                     organizations (CSOs) filed a separate petition to the Chief Justice also requesting
                     that a tribunal be established under Section 17 of the Act to determine whether
                     Ambassador Kiplagat had engaged in misbehaviour and misconduct and
                     whether his presence in the Commission violated the newly ratified Constitution
                     of Kenya.

             23.	    There then followed a curious set of letters between the Chief Justice and
                     members of civil society concerning their petition and the petition of the
                     Commission. On 16 September 2010 the Chief Justice responded to the CSOs
                     concerning their petition, and copied the letter to the Commission. The letter
                     from the Chief Justice informed the CSOs that a response concerning the petition
                     against Ambassador Kiplagat had already been made to the Commission.

             24.	    The copy of the letter to the Commission included two additional letters that
                     the Commission later learned were not included in the original letter sent to the
                     CSOs. First there was a letter dated 7 September 2010 to the Secretary of the
                     Commission in which the Chief Justice noted he had forwarded a copy of the
                     Commission’s petition to the Attorney General on 3 May 2010. This was curious
                     given the fact that the Act did not indicate any role for the Attorney General with
                     respect to a request for a tribunal under Section 17. This was also the first time
                     the Commission had received such a letter from the Chief Justice.




128          REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION
                                                                                          Vol u m e I   Chapter FOUR




25.	   Secondly, also attached was a copy of a letter sent from the Chief Justice to
       the Attorney General dated 3 May 2010 requesting that the Attorney General,
       ‘in his role as the Principal Legal Advisor to the Government of Kenya’, advise
       the Chief Justice if the grounds listed in the Commission’s petition ‘satisfy the
       requirements of the law precedent to setting up a tribunal as set out in S. 17(1)
       of the said Act’.

26.	   By the end of September 2010 the Commission had been waiting for over five
       months for a response to its petition before the Chief Justice.

27.	   In October 2010, Ambassador Kiplagat gave a nationally televised interview
       concerning the Wagalla Massacre in which for the first time he publicly admitted
       that he had been present in Wajir for a meeting of the Kenya Intelligence
       Committee on 8 February 1984, because another participant at that meeting had
       confirmed to him that they both had been present. When he was reminded of his
       presence at the Wajir meeting Ambassador Kiplagat declared with certainty that
       the Kenya Intelligence Committee meeting did not discuss a security operation.
       He later asserted that the sole purpose of the visit of the Kenya Intelligence
       Committee to Wajir and to other parts of the then North Eastern Province was for
       development purposes and not security.

28.	   In addition, in that same nationally televised interview he stated, in response to a
       question about government responsibility for the Wagalla Massacre, the following:
          I doubt, I find it extremely difficult, no government worth its salt plans to massacre its
          people.

29.	 Lessons of history show that far too often governments unfortunately do
     massacre their own people. By stating a conclusion concerning government
     responsibility for the Wagalla Massacre Ambassador Kiplagat was engaging in
     just the sort of activity that had led to the original concerns about the conflict of
     interest his inclusion in the Commission presented. As the official spokesperson
     of the Commission his statements suggested that the Commission had already
     prejudged an issue that it was in fact still investigating. Even more, he was making
     such a statement about an incident in which he himself had been implicated and
     was under investigation.

30.	   In the same month of October 2010 the Parliamentary Legal Affairs Committee
       requested an update from the Commission on how the issues relating to
       Ambassador Kiplagat were being addressed. The Parliamentary Committee




                              REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION                        129
Volume I   Chapter FOUR




                     announced at the end of that meeting that it was giving the Commission 72 hours
                     to find a way forward or the Committee would move to have the Commission
                     disbanded.

             31.	    Thus, on 28 October 2010, the Commission moved to the High Court for a writ of
                     mandamus to compel the Chief Justice to set up a Tribunal. Around the same time,
                     Commissioner Ronald Slye announced that he would be resigning on 1 November
                     2010 because of the impasse the Commission had reached. However, he never
                     did resign because on 29 October the Chief Justice announced that he would
                     be establishing a Tribunal to inquire into the issues raised about Ambassador
                     Kiplagat. On 1 November 2010 the Kenya Gazette published a notice from the Chief
                     Justice dated 21 October 2010 establishing the Tribunal pursuant to Section 17 of
                     the Act. It was not clear why a decision made on 21 October was never formally
                     communicated to the Commission.

             32.	    The terms of reference for the Tribunal established by the Chief Justice were
                     fundamentally different from and far broader than the issues raised by the
                     Commission in its petition. Rather than limiting the jurisdiction of the Tribunal to
                     acts committed by Ambassador Kiplagat in connection with his appointment and
                     after his appointment (the subject of the Commission’s petition), the Chief Justice
                     interpreted ‘misbehaviour and misconduct’ under Section 17(1)(a) of the Act more
                     broadly. The mandate of the Tribunal as set up by the Chief Justice was as follows:
                          To investigate the conduct of the Chairman of the Truth, Justice and Reconciliation
                          Commission, Ambassador Bethwell [sic] Kiplagat including, but not limited to, the
                          allegations that the said Chairman’s past conduct erodes and compromises his
                          legitimacy and credibility to chair the Commission; his past is riddled with unethical
                          practices and absence of integrity; he has been involved in, linked to or associated with
                          incidents considered to be abuse of human rights; is likely to be a witness in the same
                          matters that the Commission is mandated to investigate.2

             33.	    The Tribunal was given six months from the publication of the Gazette Notice to
                     investigate and report back to the Chief Justice.

             The Legal proceedings
             34.	    Upon the announcement of the creation of the Tribunal and the publication of its
                     terms of reference, Ambassador Kiplagat issued a signed media statement on 2
                     November 2010 in which he stated ‘I, indeed, very much welcome the decision of
                     the Chief Justice to ascertain the truth concerning the allegations that have been

        made against me [by establishing the Tribunal],’ and that he saw ‘the Tribunal as an
        opportunity to finally put any doubts about my credibility to rest once and for all’.

35.	    Ambassador Kiplagat also announced that he was ‘stepping aside’ from his duties
        as Chairperson and Commissioner ‘in order to allow the Tribunal to carry out its
        mandate’.

36.	    Before the Tribunal could commence its operations, one of its members declined to
        take up the appointment and the Chief Justice had to appoint a replacement which
        he did in the Gazette Notice dated 9 November 2009.3 However, the individual so
        appointed was not qualified to serve in the Tribunal as he was neither a sitting
        nor a former judge. Thus in December 2009 the Chief Justice published another
        Gazette Notice dated 1 November 2009 correcting that error and appointing an
        individual qualified under the terms of Section 17 of the Act.

37.	    In essence, the Tribunal was not properly constituted until mid-December 2010. In
        the meantime, the six months time in which it was to do its work was running out.

38.	    The Tribunal’s establishment was announced at the end of October 2009, but it
        only began its formal examination of Ambassador Kiplagat’s case in March 2010,
        four months later. The Tribunal spent much of its initial time setting up offices,
        drafting rules of procedure and lobbying for money from the Government.

39.	    Despite his openly declared promise to cooperate with the Tribunal, Ambassador
        Kiplagat filed an application before the same Tribunal challenging its jurisdiction
        as soon as it rolled out its proceedings. He argued that the Tribunal could not
        investigate his conduct prior to his appointment as the Commission’s Chairperson.
        He added that the only conduct that the Tribunal could investigate, if at all, was
        his conduct while in office (which was coincidentally consistent with the original
        petition filed by the Commissioners).

40.	    The Tribunal delivered its ruling on Kiplagat’s application on 12 April 2010 and
        held that it had jurisdiction to investigate his past conduct. It ruled that the scope
        of investigations as stipulated in the appointing instrument (Gazette Notice No.
        15894) extended to ‘the conduct of the subject (Chairperson) during the period
        pre-dating the subject’s appointment as a Commissioner and the Chairman of
        TJRC’. The Tribunal also noted that the fact that ‘the subject was interviewed or
        vetted by other organs did not mean that such organs could not have over-looked
        some aspects of the subject’s conduct prior to his appointment to the Commission’.

                                     REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION                131
Volume I   Chapter FOUR




             41.	    A week later, Ambassador Kiplagat moved to the High Court for an ex parte
                     application requesting a stay of the proceedings of the Tribunal while he sought
                     legal review of the rejection by the Tribunal of his motion challenging its jurisdiction.
                     The High Court granted the stay of the Tribunal’s proceedings on 27 April 2010.
                     In doing so, the High Court made an important point that initially informed the
                     Commission’s decision to petition for the formation of the Tribunal. It stated:
                          The issue is not whether the allegations being levelled against him [Ambassador
                          Kiplagat] are true. What is material is that the Commission will want to investigate
                          the circumstances surrounding the death of Robert Ouko, the Wagalla Massacre and
                          the Ndung’u Report on Illegal/Irregular Allocation of Public Land and in each case he
                          is being adversely mentioned. He cannot sit in judgment when the issues are being
                          discussed. Justice will cry if he were allowed to sit in judgment, be a witness and an
                          accused, all at the same time. My advise (sic) is that he should do the honourable thing.

             42.	    While Kiplagat’s challenge to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal proceeded in the
                     High Court, the six months given to it to complete its work ran out. The Tribunal
                     requested an extension of its life but the newly appointed Chief Justice, Dr. Willy
                     Mutunga, refused because, in his opinion, ‘such action would have resulted in a
                     wastage of national resources’. Thus, the Tribunal never completed its work and
                     could not advise the President, through the Chief Justice, if Ambassador Kiplagat
                     should continue as Chairperson and as a member of the Commission.

             43.	    When the High Court was to hear arguments in the case challenging the jurisdiction
                     of the now-defunct Tribunal in December 2011, Ambassador Kiplagat voluntarily
                     withdrew his challenge. The Commission did not oppose this withdrawal as it
                     removed the stay against the Tribunal’s work. This would have allowed the Chief
                     Justice to revive the old Tribunal or create a new Tribunal to address the claims
                     made in the Commission’s April 2010 petition. The withdrawal of the case in
                     effect denied the High Court the opportunity to pronounce on whether the Chief
                     Justice acted properly in establishing the Tribunal.

             44.	    After more than a year of legal activity, beginning with the creation of the
                     Tribunal in October 2010 to the withdrawal of Kiplagat’s lawsuit in December
                     2011, and more than eighteen months after the filing, with Kiplagat’s express
                     consent, of the original petition requesting a tribunal, no tribunal or court had
                     ruled on the merits of the petition concerning the conflicts of interest and alleged
                     misbehaviour and misconduct of Kiplagat.

             45.	    An issue that had been raised from the first day the Commission was created and
                     on which the Commission’s credibility hinged, was still unresolved two years later.




132          REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION
                                                                                   Vol u m e I   Chapter FOUR




The return of Ambassador Kiplagat
46.	   On 4 January 2012, Ambassador Kiplagat returned to the Commission offices
       unannounced and proceeded to occupy the office of the Acting Chairperson
       without requesting her permission to do so. When contacted that same day by
       the media, he reportedly replied, ‘I resumed office in the morning and I am back
       with a bang’.

47.	   He was in the office for three days in a row, from 4 to 6 January 2012 at a time
       when many of the other Commissioners were in the Coast region preparing for
       public hearings there. He demanded access to documents related to the Report,
       including documents to do with some of the areas in which he had a conflict of
       interest. He indicated that he had returned ‘to shape the final report’. The staff to
       their credit resisted these demands, correctly noting that the Commission had put
       in place a formal procedure that all individuals, including Commissioners, had to
       follow in order to access such documents. Informed that he could not have the
       documents he was demanding, he reportedly declared that the staff answered
       directly to him as Chairperson and to no one else. If they refused to accede to his
       demands he would have them arrested. Again to their credit the staff resisted such
       demands and upheld the internal policies of the Commission that were designed
       to protect its sensitive information.

48.	   Alarmed at the turn of events, and particularly at the reports of Ambassador
       Kiplagat’s attempts to threaten the staff to reveal sensitive information, the
       Commission wrote to the Chief Justice on 6 January 2012 requesting that he either
       reconstitute the old tribunal or constitute a new one to address the allegations
       contained in their petition of April 2010. In that letter the Commissioners informed
       the Chief Justice of the urgency of the matter, particularly given the reported
       actions of Ambassador Kiplagat described above.

49.	   On the same day, 6 January, the Commissioners wrote to Ambassador Kiplagat
       expressing concern at his reported conduct upon returning to the office, especially
       his demands to access documents related to the Report. The Commissioners
       pointed out that this was in direct contravention of the Commission’s existing
       policy.

50.	   Ambassador Kiplagat did not respond to that letter but instead issued a statement
       to the entire Commission declaring, among other things, that he was now the
       centre of power of the Commission. He declared that any Commissioner or staff
       member who was unhappy with this turn of events ‘should raise the matter with




                             REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION                  133
Volume I   Chapter FOUR




                      the appointing authority or the courts’, and that ‘[a]nything short of this will be
                      treated as insubordination, to be dealt with in accordance with the relevant legal
                      and disciplinary procedures’. He further stated:
                          The Commission and its staff are legally incapable of formulating any “existing policy” to
                          withhold the Commission’s documents from the Chairman. Any such “policy,” assuming
                          one was put up in the absence of the Chairman, is ultra vires the TJRC Act and hence null
                          and void. Accordingly, the Chairman expects every Commissioner and staff member
                          to avail to him all such of the Commission’s documents as the Chairman may from
                          time to time require in the execution and functions of his office. Any Commissioner
                          or staff member who defies any such request shall be deemed to be engaging in
                          insubordination, to be dealt with in accordance with the relevant legal and disciplinary
                          procedures. (emphasis in original)

             51.	     Ambassador Kiplagat’s statement to the entire Commission is attached to this Report
                      as Appendix 7 not only for reference but also because, in his opinion, it reflects the
                      true account of how events unfolded. Faced with Ambassador Kiplagat’s aggressive
                      assertion of authority, the Commission was concerned about his clear intention to
                      ignore any and all Commission procedures to preserve the integrity and confidentiality
                      of the information entrusted to it. The Commission was particularly concerned about the
                      confidence and security of the over 40,000 Kenyans who had trusted and engaged with
                      it, and so it went to the High Court on 10 January 2012 requesting an order to prohibit
                      Ambassador Kiplagat from returning to the Commission unless and until a competent
                      tribunal had addressed the allegations in the original petition and also requesting an
                      order requiring the Chief Justice to constitute such a tribunal.4

             52.	     On 24 February 2012, Justice Mohamed Warsame issued his ruling in the case. The
                      judge noted that ‘there could be flaws and lacuna in the way [Kiplagat] is going
                      back after he agreed to step aside for allegations against him to be investigated and
                      determined’, and that ‘none of the allegations [against Ambassador Kiplagat] have
                      been considered, investigated and determined’, but he nevertheless dismissed the
                      application.

             53.	     The learned Judge in his ruling stated that suits such as the one brought by the
                      Commission should be required to go through the Attorney General. Although he noted
                      that such a requirement was not in the TJR Act, he concluded that ‘the applicant could
                      and should have sought the opinion and advice of [the] honourable Attorney General
                      by listing of all relevant issues and seeking a cogent and clear request, reconsideration
                      of their mandate in view of the return of their Chairman [sic]’. As to whether there is merit

                Review Case No. 7 of 2012




134          REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION
                                                                                                           Vol u m e I    Chapter FOUR




        in enacting legislation requiring that cases instituted by independent commissions be
        screened in advance by the Attorney General, as suggested by the learned Judge, is
        outside the purview of the present discussion. It is nevertheless necessary to note here
        that the TJR Act contemplated no role for the Attorney General in cases instituted by it,
        and that a requirement that the Commission should have consulted with the Attorney
        General or any other outside body when acting in furtherance of its mandate would
        have compromised its independence.

54.	    While the matter before the Judge was very narrow, that is, whether or not
        Ambassador Kiplagat should be barred from the Commission until allegations
        raised against him are determined in a proper forum, the Learned Judge
        proceeded to interpret section 17 of the TJR Act which deals with the removal
        of a Commissioner. He held that section 17 prohibited a tribunal from looking
        at the past conduct of Ambassador Kiplagat – an interpretation that directly
        contradicted that of the Chief Justice who established just such a Tribunal.
        The Judge’s interpretation of section 17, nevertheless, was consistent with the
        position taken in the Commission’s original petition to the Chief Justice.

55.	    The learned Judge also admonished the Commission to understand that the
        ‘controversy once settled by the authoritative decision of the High Could should
        not be re-opened unless there are extraordinary reasons for doing so’. This was
        a particularly curious statement as the case brought by Ambassador Kiplagat
        challenging the establishment of the Tribunal was withdrawn before the court
        could rule on its merits. It is thus reasonably presumed that the learned Judge
        was referring to a separate case, Augustine Njeru Kathangu & 9 Others v TJRC and
        Bethuel Kiplagat. This was the case brought against the entire Commission and
        challenged the constitutionality of the Commission and the validity of Kiplagat’s
        appointment because of an alleged faulty oath. But as will be discussed below, the
        issues in that case were quite distinct from the issues raised in the Commission’s
        petition of April 2010 and all of the subsequent related litigation.5

56.	    Finally, the learned Judge in his ruling ordered that the costs of Ambassador
        Kiplagat related to this litigation be paid not by the Commission itself but by the
        Commissioners in their individual capacity. The learned Judge did not explain
        why he took the unprecedented step of imposing such costs on individuals
        who were not party to the suit. In other words, the suit had been filed by the
        Commission in its own name and which was by law a body corporate capable of
        suing and being sued.

Volume I   Chapter FOUR




             57.	    The learned judge read out his entire ruling on Friday 24 February 2012 at mid day
                     in open court in front of the media and the Commission’s legal representatives.
                     However, the Commission’s lawyers were informed that the written ruling was not
                     ready as certain typos and other minor edits needed to be made. The Commissioners
                     visited the Judge’s chambers that afternoon to receive the ruling, only to be told it
                     would not be ready until Monday.

             58.	    On Monday 27 February 2013, the Commission’s representatives returned to
                     the Judge’s chambers again only to be informed the ruling would be ready that
                     afternoon. In the afternoon, they were told it would be ready on Tuesday 28
                     February 2013. Meanwhile, the Commission learned that Ambassador Kiplagat had
                     received a final and signed copy of the ruling from the Court early on the morning
                     of Monday 27 February 2013. After the Commission pointed out this anomaly to
                     the Court, and after several phone calls, the Commission was finally able to receive
                     a copy of the ruling on the evening of Monday 27 February 2013.

             59.	    The Commission does not wish to speculate about what may have led to the
                     delay in the issuing of the ruling, or of the issuance of the ruling to one party and
                     not to the other. It is nevertheless important to point out that such anomalies
                     undermines individuals’ and institutions’ access to justice as guaranteed under the
                     Constitution of Kenya and relevant human rights treaties to which Kenya is a party.

             60.	    In March 2012, the Commission filed its appeal against the ruling of Judge
                     Warsame and asked for an emergency injunction to keep Ambassador Kiplagat
                     out of the Commission’s offices until the legal issues raised by the case had been
                     decided. That appeal, including the request for an emergency injunction, is still
                     pending as of April 2013.

             Mobilising sectarian support
             61.	    It is noteworthy that as part of his efforts to push for his return to the Commission,
                     Ambassador Kiplagat resorted to mobilising sectarian support. On 3 April 2012,
                     he attended a meeting convened by KAMATUSA, an association of Kalenjin,
                     Maasai, Turkana and Samburu ethnic communities. Under the banner of ‘Rift
                     Valley leaders’, the meeting demanded the unconditional return of Kiplagat.
                     They asserted that:
                          As the Rift Valley we are very concerned about the ongoing process at TJRC because of
                          lack of representation of the interests of Rift Valley region and the community at large.
                          Both the Constitution of Kenya and the TJRC Act emphasises the need for regional
                          balance in the composition of the Commission. We are perturbed by the manner
                          in which the TJRC Commissioners have orchestrated the exclusion of Ambassador

                                                                                             Vol u m e I   Chapter FOUR




            Bethuel Kiplagat from the process and the report writing thus denying the people
            of Rift Valley a voice and representation in the commission. Indeed, by posing as
            though they are the appointing authority, the commission and commissioners have
            abrogated themselves powers only preserved for Parliament and the Executive, and
            even in disregard of court’s unequivocal observations.

            Going by the manner in which Amb Kiplagat is treated, the Rift Valley has been placed in
            a situation of justified fear that the commission does not mean well for its people. Many
            of the persons summoned are from the Kalenjin community yet adequate time was not
            allocated to hearing their complaints.

            We in Rift Valley maintain a demand that Amb Kiplagat be reinstated unconditionally
            to any outstanding proceedings and be involved in the process of writing the
            Commission’s report.

62.	     This disappointing and unfortunate statement was clearly based on the erroneous
         reading of the law coupled with a lack of proper understanding of the workings
         of the Commission. The claim that the exclusion of Ambassador Kiplagat had
         the effect of ‘denying the people of Rift Valley a voice and representation in the
         commission’ had no basis both in law and fact. Neither Ambassador Kiplagat
         nor any other commissioner was appointed to the Commission to safeguard the
         interests of any specific ethnic community or region. While the TJR Act required
         the composition of the Commission to reflect regional balance,6 it was never the
         intention of Parliament that the Commissioners would represent the interests of
         their ethnic communities in the work of the Commission. If this were the case,
         the Commission would need more than 40 commissioners, each representing the
         interests of his or her ethnic community!

63.	     But more importantly, the TJR Act in itself made it clear that once elected,
         Commissioners were enjoined to act independently and to serve in their personal
         capacity. In particular, section 10(7) provided that:
            A commissioner once appointed shall cease active participation in the affairs of any
            political party or other organisation, whether registered or unregistered, propagating
            partisan views with respect to the work of the Commission.

64.	     Further, section 21(2) of the TJR Act provided that:
            Each commissioner and member of staff of the Commission shall serve in his individual
            capacity, independent of any political party, Government or other organisational interests,
            and shall avoid taking any action, which could create an appearance of partiality or
            otherwise harm the credibility or integrity of the Commission.

             65.	    In essence, by attending a meeting whose main agenda was to foster sectarian
                     interests, Ambassador Kiplagat acted in contravention of the TJR Act. In addition,
                     by failing to distance himself from the statement issued by the Rift Valley leaders,
                     he acquiesced to the erroneous notion that he was appointed to the Commission
                     to give ‘the people of Rift Valley a voice and representation in the commission’.

             66.	    The claim that the majority of persons summoned before the Commission were
                     from the Kalenjin community had no basis in fact and was simply inflammatory.
                     According to its methodology described in detail in the previous Chapter, the
                     Commission summoned individuals pursuant to a set of objective criteria; it
                     summoned individuals against whom allegations had been leveled and after
                     conducting its own investigations including the gathering of evidence. Factors such
                     as race, sex, and ethnic or social status were never and could not be considerations
                     in deciding whom to summon before the Commission.

             ‘Reconciling’ with Ambassador Kiplagat
             67.	    Given the High Court decision against restricting Ambassador Kiplagat from
                     returning to the Commission, the Commissioners established modalities for his
                     participation during the remainder of the Commission’s life. The Ministry of Justice
                     (and in particular the Minister for Justice, the Honorable Eugene Wamalwa) and
                     the Commission on Administrative Justice (CAJ) assisted the Commission in
                     establishing the terms of reference for the participation of Ambassador Kiplagat in
                     the remaining work of the commission.

             68.	    Up until the interventions of the Ministry of Justice and CAJ, the other Commissioners
                     had publicly stated that they would honour the High Court judgement and not bar
                     Ambassador Kiplagat from entering the Commission’s offices. However, they would
                     not work directly with him unless and until the issues raised by his conflicts of interest
                     had been properly investigated and adjudicated by an independent process. This
                     position was reflected in their press statement of 27 February 2012, which also noted
                     that Ambassador Kiplagat had been named adversely by dozens of witnesses before
                     the Commission and that he had already appeared as an adversely mentioned person
                     before the Commission with respect to the Wagalla Massacre. The Commission also
                     planned to call him again as an adversely mentioned person with respect to irregular
                     land acquisition and the assassination of the Honourable Dr. Robert Ouko.

             69.	    This public stand by Commissioners with respect to Ambassador Kiplagat was
                     criticised by some as defiance of the court order. Other critics raised the concern
                     that a Commission tasked with promoting reconciliation in the country did




138          REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION
                                                                                Vol u m e I   Chapter FOUR




       not appear to be able to reconcile within itself. This criticism was based on the
       erroneous assumption that there was a personal dispute between Ambassador
       Kiplagat and the rest of the Commissioners and hence the need for reconciliation
       amongst them. However, the real issue was one of principle and the correct
       interpretation of the law and the effect of the legal proceedings involving
       Ambassador Kiplagat and the Commission. It was never at any point about
       the personal relations between Kiplagat and the rest of the Commissioners. In
       any event, while the situation between Kiplagat and the other Commissioners
       illustrated conflict, the disagreement between the parties was pursued through
       existing legal and other legitimate processes. Ambassador Kiplagat was given an
       office, allowed to move freely to and from his office, and the other Commissioners
       met with him a number of times to discuss in a civil manner ways to resolve the
       conflicts created by his presence.

70.	   After a series of meetings with the Minister of Justice, Ambassador Kiplagat and
       the other Commissioners, an agreement was reached in principle to involve
       Ambassador Kiplagat in the remaining work of the Commission in a way that
       preserved the integrity of the process. In particular it was agreed that:

          a)	 Kiplagat would not be involved in the writing of the final report (in part
              because he had been absent during the period when the vast majority of
              the work of the Commission was done);

          b)	 he would be allowed to review the final report at the same time and in
              the same manner as the other Commissioners, except that Kiplagat would
              not be allowed to review those sections of the report in which he had a
              conflict of interest.

71.	   At a meeting held at the offices of the Ministry of Justice on 12 April 2012 and
       attended by all Commissioners, Ambassador Kiplagat agreed in principle not to
       be involved in the parts of the Report in which he had a conflict of interest. But
       he raised concerns about the definitions of conflict of interest involving him. He
       asked, for example, whether he would be kept out of all sections of the Report
       dealing with land or just those sections dealing with the specific land that is
       claimed he irregularly or illegally acquired. Ambassador Kiplagat and the other
       Commissioners agreed to work out these details among themselves. As a result of
       this agreement, the Minister of Justice immediately announced that Ambassador
       Kiplagat and the other Commissioners had reconciled.

72.	   On the same day that the agreement was reached between the Commissioners
       and Ambassador Kiplagat, CAJ issued an advisory opinion on the dispute

Volume I   Chapter FOUR




                      between the Commissioners and Ambassador Kiplagat. The Advisory Opinion
                      correctly set out the history of the various legal processes initiated by and against
                      Ambassador Kiplagat and the Commission and concluded, among other things,
                      that:

                          a)	 Ambassador Kiplagat should be allowed to return and sit in his office in
                              accordance with the High Court decision; and

                          b)	 Ambassador Kiplagat ‘should not participate or interfere with the
                              preparation of the TJRC Report since such participation may have a
                              negative effect to the acceptance of the Report’, but that he should
                              ‘be given an opportunity to review the Report within a short time and
                              to script an addendum to the Report wherein he may agree or give his
                              dissenting opinion’.

             73.	 The Advisory Opinion also made reference to the ‘sectarian support’ which
                  Ambassador Kiplagat had mobilised to push for his return. The Office of the
                  Ombudsman noted that such support ‘ultimately undermines Kiplagat’s authority’
                  and noted that attempts by Ambassador Kiplagat or other Commissioners to
                  seek such sectarian support ‘will only seek to erode the integrity of the Report’. A
                  full copy of the Advisory Opinion is attached to this Report.7

             74.	     Following up on the agreement between Ambassador Kiplagat and the other
                      Commissioners facilitated by the Minister of Justice, the Commissioners drafted
                      an Aide Memoire that set out the history of the events surrounding Ambassador
                      Kiplagat’s conflicts of interest and the many different attempts to address those
                      conflicts.8 The Aide Memoire proposed a set of modalities that would govern his
                      participation in the work of the Commission during the remainder of its life. The
                      proposed modalities were drafted based upon the meetings facilitated by the
                      Minister of Justice, the Advisory Opinion issued by the Office of the Ombudsman,
                      and consultations with experts in the area of conflicts of interest. The resulting
                      modalities were four:

                          a)	 Ambassador Kiplagat will review drafts of the Report in the same manner
                              and at the same time as other Commissioners.

                          b)	 Ambassador Kiplagat will not be allowed to review those sections of the
                              Report that concern areas in which he has a conflict of interest, including
                              those parts of the Report concerning massacres, political assassinations, and

140          REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION
                                                                                  Vol u m e I   Chapter FOUR




              land. Ambassador Kiplagat will be given the same rights and opportunities
              as any other adversely mentioned person. Thus if the Report includes an
              adverse finding concerning Ambassador Kiplagat, he will be given the same
              opportunity as other adversely mentioned individuals to respond to that
              finding and to have his response taken into account in the final drafting of
              that finding.

          c)	 Since Ambassador Kiplagat has refused to honor a summons to testify
              before the Commission, the Commission reserves the right to pursue legal
              enforcement of its summons as provided for under Section 7(6) of the Act.

          d)	 Ambassador Kiplagat must agree to comply with the decision-making
              processes of the Commission set forth in the Act and as established by
              resolutions of the Commission.

75.	   Ambassador Kiplagat was given a copy of this Aide Memoire in early April 2012
       and requested to either agree to its contents or submit a counter-proposal to
       the other Commissioners in writing. He never responded to the contents of
       the Aide Memoire, and as such, the other Commissioners and the Commission
       staff operated pursuant to the four modalities set forth in that document. In a
       Commission meeting in March 2013, almost a year after the Aide Memoire was
       given to him, Ambassador Kiplagat claimed that he did not understand that
       there was any agreement between himself and the other Commissioners as set
       forth in the Aide Memoire, and that he wanted access and the ability to comment
       on drafts of the three chapters in which he has a conflict of interest. The other
       Commissioners refused to renegotiate the agreement at this late date. As such,
       the Commission can categorically state that the final drafts of the chapters of the
       Report dealing with land, political assassinations, and massacres were drafted
       without any input or influence by Kiplagat. As a Commissioner, Ambassador
       Kiplagat was allowed to read these three chapters after they were finalized so
       that he could decide whether or not to write a response or dissenting opinion
       to the Report setting out any differences he may have with the content of those
       three chapters.

Impact of controversy
76.	   The controversy about Kiplagat’s suitability as a Chairperson of the Commission
       and the legal suits that ensued adversely affected the operations of the Commission
       throughout its life. The controversy diverted and distracted the attention and
       energy of the Commission from executing its core mandate. His initial refusal to
       step aside led to the resignation of Kaari Betty Murungi as the Vice-Chairperson and




                            REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION                  141
Volume I   Chapter FOUR




                     later as a Commissioner. This was a great loss to the Commission, as Murungi has
                     extensive experience in transitional justice, human rights law, gender and historical
                     injustices in Kenya. As Vice-Chairperson she provided crucial leadership to the
                     Commission as it grappled with the controversies surrounding the Chairperson.
                     Unfortunately, and contrary to the express provisions of the TJR Act, Murungi was
                     never replaced.

             77.	    Most importantly, the Chairperson’s refusal to step aside led to the loss of
                     important stakeholders to the work of the Commission. Social media outlets
                     were awash with calls for the disbanding of the Commission. Donor organisations
                     equally refused to fund the Commission, and those that had initially committed
                     to fund the Commission withdrew their offers. The general public, CSOs, FBOs,
                     CBOs, the media and other relevant stakeholders adopted a policy of ‘non-
                     cooperation’ with the Commission. Some of these organisations took robust steps
                     to paralyse the work of the Commission. They called on funders not to support
                     the Commission. Some, mainly under the banner of Kenya Transitional Justice
                     Network and Kenyans Against Impunity, planned to engage the Commission ‘in
                     as many legal battles as possible’ and ‘decimate or exhaust’ its capacities to move
                     on with its activities.

             78.	    The Commission does not question the good faith of many CSOs which acted
                     against it, perhaps premised on the idea of seeking a credible truth-seeking,
                     justice and reconciliation process. The Commission, however, notes that their
                     strategy inadvertently fitted well into the wishes of actors, both political and
                     otherwise, who saw the Commission and its work as a threat to the status quo and
                     their vested interests. By disengaging from the Commission and taking steps to
                     paralyse its work, these CSOs consciously or unconsciously advanced the interests
                     of non-reformists.

             79.	    Many victims, their families, and witnesses similarly refused to participate in
                     the activities of the Commission or to be associated with it in any way. When
                     the Commission set out to execute its mandate, it was met with hostility and
                     confrontation. In January 2010, for example, the Commission undertook an initial
                     civic education tour of the Coast Province. It held public information sessions in
                     Voi, Mombasa, Kwale, Malindi, and Lamu. While the public sessions achieved
                     some level of success, the Commission was plagued with demonstrations and
                     other expressions of protest at the presence of Kiplagat. At the Mombasa session,
                     dozens of people publicly protested and walked out of the session. In Lamu,
                     the Commissioners had to be confined to their hotel rooms while sympathetic
                     representatives of CSOs engaged with local community leaders to ensure the

                                                                                 Vol u m e I   Chapter FOUR




       Commissioners’ safety at that session. Following this experience, the Commission
       abandoned similar outreach and civic education visits that had been planned.

80.	   The stepping aside of the Chairperson in November 2010 dramatically changed the
       situation for the Commission. The general public and a significant number of CSOs,
       FBOs and other stakeholders put an end to their policy of non-cooperation and
       rallied behind the Commission. Buoyed by this massive support, the Commission
       worked with renewed vigour under the leadership of its Acting Chairperson, Tecla
       Namachanja Wanjala, to redeem lost time. In addition to rolling out a renewed
       civic education programme all over the country, the Commission launched public
       hearings in April 2011. The reception at these hearings was exceptionally positive,
       and when the Commission requested an extension of time to complete its hearings,
       the National Assembly unanimously supported the request.

81.	 Kiplagat’s return in January 2012 threatened to erase all the gains that the
     Commission had made during his absence. Stakeholders who had re-engaged
     with the Commission left in droves. CSOs threatened to hold protests and
     demonstrations to bar the Chairperson from attending the Commission’s public
     hearings that were due to be held in Coast Province. In Nairobi, survivors and
     families of the Wagalla Massacre held public demonstrations in front of the
     Commission’s offices protesting the return of Kiplagat. Donors who had expressed
     a willingness to support the process now withdrew their commitments of support.
     It was, for all intents and purposes, a return to square one.

Other conflicts of interest
82.	 Conflict of interest issues were not just confined to Ambassador Kiplagat
     alone. There were also allegations that Commissioner Major General (Retired)
     Ahmed Farah had been involved in the security operation that became the
     Wagalla Massacre. These allegations, just like those raised against Kiplagat, were
     supported by similar credible but not conclusive evidence (in this case a sworn
     affidavit). The Commission immediately instituted procedures to keep away any
     information or discussions related to the Wagalla Massacre from Commissioner
     Farah in accordance with the Commission’s code of conduct. Commissioner Farah
     agreed to these procedures and willingly complied.

83.	   The Commission also immediately undertook investigations into these allegations
       and established that:
          a)	 the Navy, of which General Farah was a part, was not in fact involved in any
              way with the Wagalla Massacre, and




                            REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION                 143
Volume I   Chapter FOUR




                          b)	 that General Farah was in fact out of the country before, during, and after the
                              Wagalla Massacre.

             84.	    Nevertheless, the Commission decided to hold a public hearing concerning the
                     allegations against Commissioner Farah because of the importance of engaging
                     in a public and transparent process addressing such allegations given their
                     potential to affect the credibility, integrity, and legitimacy of the Commission.

             85.	    At the public hearing, the individual who had alleged that Commissioner Farah
                     was involved in the Wagalla Massacre publicly repudiated his earlier statement
                     and swore, under oath, that he had no knowledge linking Commissioner Farah to
                     the Wagalla Massacre.9



             Financial and Resource Challenges
             86.	    The second great challenge that the Commission faced from inception was the
                     lack of sufficient funds and resources to efficiently and effectively conduct its
                     operations. Although Parties to KNDR encouraged ‘strong financial support to
                     the Commission’,10 the Commission operated on a paltry budget throughout its
                     life. The financial situation was so dire that at times it had to seek loans from
                     Commissioners.11 The preliminary cost of fulfilling the Commission’s mandate
                     effectively and efficiently was estimated to be approximately Ksh 2.2 billion for
                     the two-year operational period. This amount is comparable, when adjusted
                     for inflation, to the amount expended on the Peruvian Truth and Reconciliation
                     Commission and significantly less than that spent on the South African Truth and
                     Reconciliation Commission.

             The first fiscal year (2009-2010)
             87.	    During the Commission’s first fiscal year, its finances were entirely controlled
                     and administered by the Ministry of Justice. This situation obtained because
                     of government regulations that prohibited the Commission from controlling its
                     finances until the Secretary to the Commission, who was also the accounting
                     authority and chief executive, had been hired. However, even when the Secretary
                     was hired in February 2010, the Commission was not allowed to take control of

             9	 TJRC/Hansard/Public Hearing/Nairobi/
             10	 TJRC Agreement.
             11	 Ironically, as noted before, those same Commissioners who so generously reached into their own pockets to ensure
                 the Commission could continue with its work were later falsely accused in the media of stealing such money from the
                 Commission.

       experienced the following challenges as a result:

          a)	 it had to seek the express approval of the Ministry for any expenditure, a
              process which delayed activities;
          b)	 individual Commissioners had to rely on their personal resources when the
              Commission’s requests were delayed or denied;
          c)	 it had no authority to approve or disapprove any expenditures made on the
              Commission’s behalf by the Ministry;
          d)	 it had no knowledge of many expenditures made by the Ministry on its
              behalf; and
          e)	 despite numerous requests, the Commission was never given a complete
              account of the money spent on its behalf by the Ministry during that first
              year.

88.	   The Commission’s lack of control over its finances during the first year of operations
       was not made public until April 2010 just after the Commission announced it
       would be petitioning the Chief Justice to establish a tribunal with respect to the
       issues raised by Kiplagat. Around that same time the then Minister of Justice, the
       Honorable Mutula Kilonzo, indicated in a number of public statements that the
       Commission may have engaged in inappropriate and perhaps even illegal financial
       activities. As a result of these allegations, the Parliamentary Public Accounts
       Committee and the Parliamentary Committee on the Administration of Justice and
       Legal Affairs undertook an investigation of the matter. In response, the Commission
       submitted detailed financial documents to the respective Committees and noted
       that because it had no control over its own finances any questions concerning the
       finances of the Commission (including questions the Commission itself had raised
       concerning some of the documents it had provided) should be directed to the
       Ministry of Justice.

89.	   For the 2009-2010 fiscal year, the Commission submitted to the Treasury a budget of
       Ksh 1.2 bn but was only allocated Ksh 190 million, or just under 16% of its proposed
       budget. As with most such allocations, the Ksh 190 million was transferred to the
       Commission’s account with the Ministry of Justice in three quarterly instalments,
       each of which was insufficient to service the Commission’s growing portfolio of
       debts and pay staff salaries, much less finance mandate-related operations. As a
       consequence, the Commission deferred the hiring of staff until August 2010 and
       froze all but the most essential mandate-related operations.

Volume I   Chapter FOUR




             The second fiscal year (2010-2011)
             90.	    By the end of October 2010, the Commission had no funds at all to sustain its
                     operations and had to seek monthly advances amounting to Ksh 44.2 million from the
                     Treasury for the months of November and December to pay staff salaries and continue
                     statement taking. Similarly, in order to run its operations, the Commission sought and
                     received an advance of Ksh 80 million from the Ministry of Justice. These advances
                     kept the Commission going but they were temporary solutions to a chronic financial
                     problem. They were uncertain and ad hoc and so the Commission could not plan its
                     activities properly resulting in, among other things, inadequate civic education and
                     preparation for the Commission’s statement taking and public hearings.

             91.	    In December 2010 the Commission submitted a request to the Treasury for
                     supplementary funding. Without the supplementary funding the Commission
                     was unable to launch its public hearings in February 2011 as was initially planned.
                     The Commission received Ksh 460 million in April 2011 in response to its request.
                     The Commission was thus able to launch and conduct hearings at the beginning
                     of April 2011 in North Eastern, Upper Eastern and Mt. Elgon.

             92.	    In the fiscal year 2010-2011, the Commission was eventually allocated a total
                     of Ksh 650 million against a proposed budget of Ksh 1.2 billion. The inadequate
                     funding in the first fiscal year, and the late allocation in its second fiscal year,
                     placed great strains on the Commission’s operations. In particular:
                     	   The Commission was unable to start its operations after the statutorily stipulated
                          three month establishment phase. For the first six months of its existence, with
                          no control over its limited funding, the Commission operated with neither a
                          Secretary nor a functional Secretariat. The Commissioners performed most of
                          the administrative and organisational work with the assistance of a 17 member
                          support staff deployed to the Commission by the Ministry of Justice.

                     	   Although the Commission finally hired its Secretary in February 2010, it was
                          unable to undertake any substantial hiring of staff until the 2010-2011 fiscal
                          year. The operational units of the Commission thus became functional only in
                          September 2010 after directors and staff of the various units were hired and
                          inducted. But these units remained under-funded and under­­­­  -staffed, a fact
                          that undermined their capacity to function effectively.
                     	   The Commission did not have adequate and appropriate office space
                          until January 2011, more than sixteen months after its establishment. The
                          Commission delayed the hiring of needed staff until towards the end of 2010
                          for lack of office space. As a result some individuals who had applied for jobs
                          with the Commission took up other job offers.

                                                                                      Vol u m e I   Chapter ONE




       	   The Commission had recurrent delays in paying bills and salaries. Indeed,
            the Commissioners had to loan the Commission money to enable it to
            commence the statement taking process.

       	   The Commission had to cut short its provincial outreach and familiarisation
            meetings after conducting such meetings in only two provinces.

       	   The Commission was unable to conduct intensive training sessions for Statement
            Takers, especially in relation to trauma management and identification. Many
            Statement Takers were subject to trauma but the Commission could only organise
            two debriefing sessions for them. These were during the review meetings and
            at the end of the official statement taking period. The statement taking process
            identified many victims and witnesses who needed counseling but given the
            Commission’s limited financial and other resources, limited counseling services
            were provided.

       	   The Commission’s launch of public hearings was delayed, first for one
            year, then for an additional two months. According to the work plan, the
            Commission had intended to hold hearings beginning in April 2010 but this
            was revised when it became clear that the Commission would be unable to
            hire staff until after July 2010, and that no money would be available other
            than for minimal operational activities until that time. The revised Work Plan
            set a hearing period of 7 months from February 2011 to August 2011. Due
            to lack of funds, the launch of the hearings was delayed again until April
            2011 when the Commission received an advance of Ksh 80 million from the
            Ministry of Justice. This delay in commencing public hearings adversely
            affected the Commission’s schedule which had to be compressed.

       	   The delay in commencing hearings in turn had an adverse ‘ripple effect’ on
            the general Work Plan of the Commission. The most far-reaching impact
            was that the Commission was unable to hold public hearings in some parts
            of the country and on the entire breadth of issues within its mandate. These
            delays contributed significantly to the Commission’s requests for extension
            of its lifetime discussed earlier in Chapter One of this Volume of the Report.

93.	   The Commission’s paltry budget was, towards the end of its term, supplemented by
       external donors, most of whom provided aid in the form of technical support. Initially,
       however, donors had generally refused to fund the Commission in any way. At the
       beginning of the Commission’s life potential donors conditioned their support on the
       establishment of a Special Tribunal for Kenya as recommended by the Commission of
       Inquiry into the Post-Election Violence (CIPEV), a matter over which the Commission
       had no control. Most importantly, the overwhelming number of donors declined to

Volume I   Chapter ONE




                      support the Commission in view of the controversy that surrounded the suitability
                      of the Chairperson. In addition, donors expressed misgivings at providing funding
                      to a process that was meant to be national but which was so underfunded by the
                      Government. As one donor expressed to the Commission, it would have been
                      inappropriate for the process to be a donor-driven project.



             Legal Challenges
             94.	     The Commission was a corporate body with perpetual succession and a common
                      seal and was capable of suing and being sued in its own name.12 Soon after its
                      establishment, two legal actions were lodged in the High Court, both of which
                      sought the dissolution of the Commission. The substance, outcomes and impact of
                      the two cases are discussed in this sub-section.

             	     Augustine Njeru Kathangu & 9 Others v TJRC and Bethuel Kiplagat
                    [High Court Misc App No. 470 of 2009]
             95.	     The Applicants in this case were members of a lobby group, Kenyans Against Impunity,
                      which was formed in the aftermath of the 2007/08 PEV. They were also victims of
                      violations that fell under the Commission’s scope of inquiry. They raised a constitutional
                      challenge on the composition and statutory mandate of the Commission.

             96.	 They challenged the process of nominating the Commissioners arguing that,
                  contrary to the provisions of the TJR Act, the Selection Panel that was responsible
                  for their nomination was not properly constituted. In particular, they argued that
                  representatives of the Episcopal Conference of Kenya, the National Council of
                  Christian Churches of Kenya and the Federation of Kenya Women Lawyers had not
                  participated in the selection process. The Court found this contention lacked merit
                  in part because some of these organisations were in fact represented in the selection
                  process and the absence of specific religious organisations did not invalidate the
                  process. Those organisations participated in a process by which the two religious
                  organisations among them were represented on the panel.

             97.	     They also challenged Ambassador Kiplagat’s suitability to serve as the Commission’s
                      Chairperson for reasons already discussed earlier. They asked the Court to quash
                      his oath of office and prohibit him from running the affairs of the Commission.
                      They argued that the Chairperson’s oath of office (and by extension of all the other
                      Commissioners) was null and void because it was administered on 3 August 2009 yet
                      the Gazette Notice appointing them was published much later on 14 August 2009.

             12	 TJR Act, sec 2.




148          REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION
                                                                                           Vol u m e I   Chapter ONE




       In essence they argued that the President had put the cart before the horse. The
       Court found this contention to be without merit. It ruled that what was relevant was
       not the date on which the Gazette Notice was published but the date on which the
       President signed it, and that was 22 July 2009. As such, the Court concluded that ‘the
       issue of putting the cart before the horse as contended by the ex parte applicants has
       absolutely no basis’.

98.	   On the Applicants’ prayer to prohibit Ambassador Kiplagat from running the affairs
       of the Commission, the Court based its ruling on a technicality, arguing that the
       Applicant’s request for an order of prohibition was inappropriate given that they
       were not challenging the manner in which Ambassador Kiplagat was running the
       Commission but the authority to appoint him as Chairman of the Commission. The
       Court also noted that such an order of prohibition would only address claims raised
       about the process of Ambassador’s Kiplagat’s appointment and not the merits of his
       appointment, which consequently were not addressed by the Court. As such, the
       Court concluded that:
          The ex parte applicants are not challenging the decision making process in the
          appointment of 2nd respondent [Kiplagat]. They are challenging the merit of the 2nd
          respondent’s selection and nomination, being of the view that the 2nd respondent was not
          a suitable person for nomination. As we have pointed out the remedy of prohibition does
          not deal with the merit of the decision but with the process. For this and other reasons
          already stated the remedy of prohibition as sought by the ex parte applicants is therefore
          not available to them.

99.	   In relation to the statutory mandate of the Commission, the Applicants averred that
       the TJR Act was unconstitutional to the extent that it excluded the periods before
       12 December 1963 and after 28 February 2008 from its temporal mandate. The
       Court did not delve into the merits of this contention. Instead, it ruled that while the
       Applicants raised important issues, they could not challenge the legality of the TJR
       Act in the manner in which they did, that is, through a judicial review process rather
       than through a constitutional reference.

100.	 Ambassador Kiplagat and the Commission argued before the Court that the only
      proper procedure for the removal of a Commissioner, which was in part what
      the Applicant’s were seeking, was through the creation of a Tribunal pursuant to
      Section 17 of the Act. The Court did not comment on this argument, other than to
      note that it had been made.

101.	 The ruling of the Court in this case was particularly important in view of the different
      interpretations accorded it by interested parties. As noted above, Ambassador
      Kiplagat returned to the Commission’s offices in January 2012 in part arguing
      that the dismissal of this case meant that he had been ‘cleared’ of all allegations



                              REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION                        149
Volume I   Chapter ONE




                     raised against him. It is also possible, as noted above, that the ruling of the High
                     Court in TJRC v Bethuel Kiplagat & Chief Justice denying the Commission the right to
                     bar Kiplagat from its offices may also have depended upon this ruling. The media
                     accepted this interpretation, and with few exceptions, reported that Kiplagat had
                     been ‘cleared’ by the courts.

             102.	 On the contrary, the Commission held the considered view that the case had neither
                   cleared the Chairperson of allegations levelled against him nor did it pronounce on
                   the substance of those allegations. In other words, the High Court never dealt with
                   the question of whether the allegations levelled against Ambassador Kiplagat were
                   true or false. Instead, it ruled that it (the Court) was not the proper forum to address
                   those issues and that they had not been properly presented by the Applicants in
                   that case. The Court also noted that the Commission and Ambassador Kiplagat had
                   argued that the only proper forum for addressing such issues was a Tribunal set up
                   under section 17 of the Act. As noted above, notwithstanding this earlier argument
                   supported by Kiplagat, when such a tribunal was later established it was challenged
                   by Kiplagat.

             	    Moraa Gesicho v Attorney General and TJRC [High Court (Kisii) Petition
                   No. 1 of 2010]
             103.	 The petitioner in this case described herself as a victim of the 2007/08 PEV. She
                   sought a declaration from the High Court that the Commission had no basis
                   upon which to pursue justice for victims of the PEV. She therefore prayed for the
                   dissolution of the Commission. Her argument was based on a perceived failure
                   by the Commission of Inquiry into the Post-Election Violence (CIPEV) to make
                   specific recommendations to the Truth Justice and Reconciliation Commission
                   as expressly required by its terms of reference. The legal instrument that created
                   CIPEV (Gazette Notice No. 4473) mandated it to ‘make such recommendations to
                   the Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission as the Commission [CIPEV] may
                   deem appropriate’.

             104.	 The Commission opposed her petition on simple reasoning. The purported failure
                   of CIPEV to make any specific recommendation to the Commission did not bar the
                   latter from pursuing justice for victims of PEV. The 2007/08 PEV squarely fell both
                   within the temporal and material mandate of the Commission. Indeed, hundreds of
                   victims of PEV participated in the Commission’s processes; they recorded statements
                   and testified before the Commission. Their statements, testimonies and views were
                   taken into account in drawing up the findings and recommendations and compiling
                   of this Report.

             105.	 The case had not been finalized by the time of submitting this Report.

                                                                                              Vol u m e I   Chapter ONE




Lack of Political Will
106.	 The two major challenges discussed above – the response to the controversy
      around the Chairperson and the financial and resource constraints that the
      Commission faced – were products of and symptomatic of a bigger challenge:
      the lack of sufficient political will on the part of the state to give the Commission
      the support it needed and to commit to pursue the objectives for which the
      Commission was established.

107.	 The state’s lack of political will to support the work of the Commission was manifested
      in many diverse ways. Firstly, in spite of the express and mandatory provisions of the
      TJR Act, the President failed to fill the position of Commissioner Kaari Betty Murungi
      when it fell vacant in April 2010. This forced the Commission to operate with eight
      Commissioners, and later when Ambassador Kiplagat stepped aside, with only seven
      commissioners. Secondly, despite multiple requests, the state refused to hand over
      to the Commission relevant documents pertaining to its mandate, including the
      reports of previous commissions of inquiry that the Commission was obligated to
      review and evaluate.13 Because of this consistent lack of cooperation, the Commission
      was forced to acquire many relevant documents, including the reports of previous
      commissions of inquiry, through unofficial and informal means.

108.	 Thirdly, the state’s failed to support adequately the Commission’s reconciliation
      work. The Commission’ mandate of promoting national unity and reconciliation
      demanded strong political support. By their stature and position in society,
      political leaders, especially the President and the Prime Minister, had key roles to
      play in steering the nation towards national unity and reconciliation. However,
      their support for this particular work was ad hoc and inconsistent. Only a few
      political leaders publicly spoke of national unity and reconciliation within the
      framework of the TJR Act. Political leaders, more often than not, took steps that
      undermined national unity and reconciliation. Many other political leaders
      through their inaction and lack of support contributed to this atmosphere and
      thus lessened the ability of the Commission to perform its functions. Some made
      inflammatory statements that spurred ethnic tension.

109.	 Not surprisingly in January 2012, the KNDR Monitoring Project warned that:
             The Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission (TJRC) and the National Cohesion
             and Integration Commission (NCIC) have continued their efforts to inquire into human
             rights violations and prevent future violence, respectively. However, without political
             support for the work of these commissions, their impact on ethnic relations and deterrence
             capacity for future dissonance remains uncertain.

             110.	 It is significant that until the handing over of this Report, the Commission was
                   unable to secure an appointment to meet with the President. From the earliest days
                   of the establishment of the Commission in August 2009 the Commission sought
                   an audience with the President but the efforts were in vain. The Commission also
                   had difficulty meeting the Prime Minister. It pursued an appointment with the
                   Prime Minister both with or without the President but it was virtually more than
                   half way through its work when the Commission was able to pay a courtesy call
                   on the Prime Minister. This lack of access to the two Principals was one of the
                   many indicators of the lack of interest or indifference to the Commission from
                   the political elite.

             111.	 This lack of political will on the part of the political elite may partly have stemmed
                   from the absence of a clean break with the past. It could also be attributed to the
                   fact that many state and public officials who served under previous repressive and
                   corrupt regimes were also serving in the Coalition Government. They had either
                   participated in or oversaw acts of repression and corruption during periods that
                   were squarely within the mandate of the Commission. Many of these individuals
                   had an interest in maintaining the status quo and a complete break with the past
                   could potentially or actually injure their vested interests.

             112.	 In August 2009, Professor Yash Pal Ghai, a leading constitutional law scholar,
                   had already foreseen that anti-reformists would sabotage the country’s reform
                   and transitional justice agenda. Writing on the challenges of establishing a
                   constitutional order in Kenya, he observed that he had already:
                          said enough to indicate how vested interests, among politicians, businesspeople,
                          and the bureaucracy will sabotage reforms (as they have done ever since Kenya’s
                          independence). Despite the ravages wreaked upon the state, it still remains the
                          primary means to accumulate wealth and power—and those who are in control of
                          it will fight to maintain their control, regardless of the rules of the constitution. It
                          is hard to provide the answer to this dilemma, that the very sponsors of reform are its
                          principal saboteurs. What we know is that constitutionalism cannot be willed; it must
                          be established by deep commitment and sustained activity.14

             113.	 Not surprisingly, despite the numerous institutional and legislative reforms
                   (including the enactment of a new constitution and the reform of the judiciary)
                   which followed the signing of the National Accord, the government continued to
                   exhibit and resort to past practices and tendencies. In a sense, systematic violations
                   of human rights and disregard for the rule of law continued way into an era which
                   was supposed to be marked by a clean break with the past. It mattered little that
                   by signing the National Accord and engaging in the KNDR process, the country’s

152          REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION
                                                                                                             Vol u m e I   Chapter ONE




        political leadership had formally committed itself to recreating the Kenyan State
        through a more transparent and accountable form of governance. The renewed
        optimism after the signing of the National Accord was even shorter-lived than that
        which accompanied the entry of the NARC government in 2002.

114.	 Examples abound of how, soon after signing of the National Accord, state
      agencies once again started sliding back to past practices. In 2008, for instance,
      in a security operation dubbed Operation Okoa Maisha, the army tortured and
      maimed suspected members of the Sabaot Land Defence Force (SLDF) in the
      Mount Elgon region. Reports of economic crimes and grand corruption involving
      top government officials continued to hit the headlines. Between July 2008 and
      January 2009, KNDR Monitoring Project listed at least six cases of corruption in
      which government officials were allegedly or reportedly involved:15

         	   In July 2008, the Minister for Immigration was accused of giving work permits
              to foreigners against advice from senior Ministry officials. The Kenya Anti-
              Corruption Commission detectives revealed an elaborate cartel of brokers
              who were making billions of Kenya shillings at the Ministry;

         	   In July 2008, the Minister for Finance was accused of flouting public procurement
              rules and irregularly selling the Grand Regency Hotel;

         	   In October 2008, a saga surrounding the destination of a Ukrainian vessel
              that was hijacked by Somali pirates off the Kenyan coast with 33 T-72 Russian
              made tanks, 23 aircraft guns and ammunition was reported. While the Kenya
              Government insisted that the weapons were for its military, there were
              allegations that the arms were imported on behalf of the Government of
              Southern Sudan;

         	   In September 2008, Finance Minister Amos Kimunya denied allegations that a
              currency-printing contract was irregularly awarded to De la Rue. The government
              was said to have lost billions of shillings in the deal;

         	   In October 2008, the National Social Security Fund was said to have lost Ksh3
              billion in pensioners’ funds through dubious investments, including the
              sinking of about Ksh1.5 billion in the stock brokerage firm, Discount Securities
              Limited, which has since been placed under statutory management;

         	   In January 2009, the Kenya Pipeline Company and Triton Petroleum Company
              Limited were at the centre of a scandal in which financiers risked losing up to
              Ksh7.6 billion;

Volume I   Chapter ONE




                      	    In January 2009, there were allegations that the Kenya Tourism Board Managing
                            Director irregularly allocated Ksh 43 million to two private companies;

                      	    In January 2009, it was reported that maize meant to cushion Kenyans against
                            rising food prices and looming starvation had been allocated to briefcase
                            millers and companies that were colluding with senior government officials.
                            This maize was allegedly sold to Southern Sudan at a higher price. Thus over
                            Ksh 800 million was reported to have been lost in the fraud.

             115.	 The fact that the state continued to behave in much the same way as it did in the
                   past, coupled with the fact that the structures of governance were dominated
                   by holdovers from the previous regimes, had a negative impact both on the
                   operations of the Commission and the public perception of its work. Many
                   people were often doubtful whether the recommendations of the Commission
                   would be implemented. They repeatedly expressed their concern that little had
                   changed despite the signing of the National Accord and the legislative reforms
                   that followed. In an apt metaphor, a witness summarised the concern thus:
                          There is a parable which says that a goat was eaten by a hyena and then the goats
                          went and said to other hyenas, ‘We were eaten by a hyena. Can you help us?’ The
                          hyena went to other hyenas and said: ‘If you ate some goats, why did you not eat all
                          of them, so that we could not hear any complaints?’ By this I mean that unless there
                          will be another government, but the one I know, the people I hear, are the same
                          ones who caused us the pain.16




             Conclusion
             116.	 The Commission, like many that have gone before it both in Kenya and abroad,
                   faced many challenges. Some of these challenges, as described in this Chapter,
                   at times threatened the very existence of the organization and took a physical
                   and emotional toll on the Commissioners and the staff of the Commission. The
                   Commission faced these challenges with courage, conviction, and commitment.
                   How well it succeeded in the end is not for it to say. Instead, the Commission
                   hopes that its work, as documented in this Report, will in the end contribute to
                   truth, justice, national unity and reconciliation in Kenya.

                 that happened to family members or friends, but they are less willing to speak of their own
                 suffering. Please don’t forget to tell us what happened to you yourself if you were the victim of
                 a gross human rights abuse.

           •	    The Commission is concerned and is committed to the security of all persons that give
                 statements. Kindly communicate to the commission your concerns on security at the earliest
                 possible opportunity.

Guide for Focused Group Discussions on the Nature
and Extent of Violations of Socio-Economic Rights and
on Perception of Economic Marginalisation

                                                        November 2011

[Target Groups: inhabitants of regions; members of ethnic minority group/indigenous group (mixed men +women or
separately); women; the poor (urban and rural)]
		
A: Introduction
The Truth Justice and Reconciliation Commission (TJRC) is mandated to inquire into economic marginalisation. In particular, it
is required to inquire into perceptions of economic marginalisation by different sectors of society — regions, ethnic minorities,
women, the poor (urban and rural) and youth — and to make appropriate recommendations for this to be addressed.

Aim of the FGDs
The Commission is organising countrywide Focused Group Discussions (FGDs) targeting the listed groups in various regions
in order to elicit views and therefore enhance the Commission’s understanding relating to: 1) whether the groups perceive
themselves to be economically marginalised and if yes, how; 2) any facts/evidence they may have that supports their perceived
marginalisation; 3) what recommendations the Commission should make in relation to any perceived economic marginalisation.

Economic Marginalisation
Marginalization is the social process of becoming or being made marginal (especially as a group within the larger society).
Those who are marginalised exist on the periphery of society often not just in terms of distance from the centre (of economic and
political power in Nairobi) but they also lag behind an expected level of performance in economic, political and social well being
compared with average condition in the society as a whole.

Economic marginalization is produced by the process through which groups are discriminated directly or indirectly, in the
distribution of social goods and services such as healthcare, education, social security, water and food, housing, land and
physical infrastructure (roads, schools, health facilities): in general, expenditure on development. While in the economic sphere
individuals and groups could be pushed to the margins by the operation of market forces and this is found perfectly legal, it is the
intervention of the state and its agents in a variety of ways to tip the balance unfairly in favour of particular regions or groups — or
its failure to intervene in favour of the vulnerable that is blameworthy and therefore subject of this inquiry.

For our purposes, discrimination is understood as ‘any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on any ground such
as race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic origin which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition,
enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of rights or social goods and services.
While economic marginalisation is a distinct concept, it is linked with social and political marginalisation. Economically
marginalized groups tend to be socially marginalized as well: they are disadvantaged with respect to both resources and power.

The Idea of ‘Perception’
Perception relates to how one views, interprets or ‘perceives’ a particular situation, for our purposes, whether one is economically




                                      REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION                                           207
Volume I         APPENDICES




      included or marginalised. From an individual perspective, how one views or understands a situation is a form of personal truth.
      From a group/society’s perspective, this would amount to societal truth. Because of the subjectivity involved (in personal and
      societal truth), a perception is in essence a belief, rather than tested reality, which is factually proved/provable and is related
      to or amounts to forensic/factual truth. While perceptions about something or a situation (by an individual or group) could be
      unfounded, it is not always the case because perception could in fact reflect (provable) reality which is established when that
      belief/feeling is investigated.

      The purpose of this study (FGDs) is not necessarily to tease out the reality (factual) about economic marginalisation. Rather, it
      aims to elicit views held by the designated groups from their perspective whether they believe/feel they have been economically
      marginalised. These are personal or societal truths that the TJRC needs to acknowledge and validate while of course presenting
      another (factual) narrative (to the extent that it exists and is at variance with perceptions held) about economic marginalisation.


      B: General Instructions for the FGD Facilitator
           •	     Introduce yourself and the note-taker in the language that the members are conversant with.
           •	     Explain the importance of the TJRC’s work in particular that relating to economic marginalisation and the importance
                  of the FGD.
           •	     Inform participants that the information they will provide is particularly useful to the Commission: it will form part
                  of the Final Report (the main product of the Commission’s work) and; it will assist the commission in formulating
                  recommendations to address economic marginalisation.
           •	     Answer all questions the participants have to ask before you start the session
           •	     Let them know about how long the session will last
           •	     Tell them that all answers are correct. There are no wrong answers
           •	     Remind them that participation is voluntary. They can withdraw from the process if they like.
           •	     Remind participants that the information collected from them shall be treated with utmost confidentiality and shall not

      D. FGD Question Items (Disaggregated)
      I. GENERAL QUESTIONS RELATED TO ECONOMIC MARGINALISATION (FGDs for regions)
                  1.	   There is often the belief that some regions or groups in Kenya have been marginalised, especially economically.
                        What is your understanding of (economic) marginalisation?
                             •	 Probe (use probing or substantiating questions) to establish participants’ understanding of related
                                    concepts such as political marginalisation and social (exclusion) marginalisation.

                              •	   Once views are expressed on this issue, validate key views from participants and share the TJRC’s
                                   vision/understanding of economic marginalisation.

                  2.	   Do you believe that as a region you have been marginalised economically?

           •	    Probe to establish in relation to what issues they feel marginalised:
                        o	 Is it the distribution of physical infrastructure such as roads, schools, hospitals etc?
                        o	 Distribution of social goods and services such as health facilities and healthcare; housing;
                             education (schools); social security; water and food?
                        o	 Representation in public employment (public/civil service)?
                        o	 Probe further to establish whether it relates to distribution of land (or other injustices
                             around land), a primary means of production?
                        o	 Other things done/not done?
           •	    If the language of ‘historical injustice’ is used, probe to establish what participants think it means and
                 whether they think it was intended or has had the effect of marginalising them economically

3.	   Who do you blame/who do you believe is responsible for your marginalisation?

           •	    Probe to establish whether they have any specific actors in mind (this can be the government;
                 specific ethnic group; rich neighbours; local MP; colonial government; NGOs; Local leaders etc)
           •	    Probe to establish who in their view they think is the most responsible for their economic
                 marginalisation.
           •	    Clarify that government refers to the three arms of government as well as other state institutions
                 (like parastatals). Clarify further that government relates not only to central government in Nairobi
                 but also local government (local authorities).

4.	   Why do you think that you are marginalised?
           •	    Because we want to get some specifics on why they feel marginalised (which is general), probe
                 to obtain some facts on things that make them reach the conclusion that they are marginalised
                 economically.
           •	    Ask them to describe/ provide any information they may have on the status of Socio-Economic
                 Rights.

5.	   What do you think are the reasons (political, economic or cultural) for your economic marginalisation?
      •	   Let discussion flow freely but probe appropriately to establish whether it is their culture? Lifestyle?
           Unsustainable economic activity? Examples can be: reliance on rain-fed agriculture; pastoralism (other
           than being unsustainable economically, it interferes with children’s education etc)? Is it customs that bar
           members of their community from owning land or engaging economically?
      •	   Is it their politics (remember Moi’s ‘siasa mbaya, maisha mbaya’ meaning don’t support me and you will
           suffer)?
      •	   What about poor leadership, including among local leaders?

6.	   How have you (as a group) coped with economic marginalisation?
      •	   Probe to establish how their marginalisation made them feel. Did they feel unwanted, as foreigners?
      •	   Probe to establish how their marginalisation affected their view of things, how it affected how they viewed
           and related to others (members of other communities?)

7.	   What do you think should be done to address the legacy of economic marginalisation?

      •	   Elicit views freely without going into what the new constitution provides unless it comes up early in the
           discussion.
      •	   Probe to establish how they think the new constitution has changed their situation.
      •	   Probe further to establish specific things about the new constitution that should be emphasized. These
           can relate to: the Bill of Rights; Devolution; Equalisation fund; land reforms etc

8.	   What do they see as their role in addressing economic marginalisation?

      •	 Probe to establish how they think the new constitution has changed their situation.
      •	 Probe further to establish specific things about the new constitution that should be emphasized. These
            can relate to: the Bill of Rights; Devolution; Affirmative action; Equalisation fund; land reforms etc

             THE COMMISSION ON ADMINISTRATIVE JUSTICE
             ADVISORY OPINION ON THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION

             The Commission on Administrative Justice (hereinafter referred to as the Commission) is a Constitutional
             Commission established pursuant to Article 59 (4) and Chapter 15 of the Constitution of Kenya, as read
             with The Commission on Administrative Justice Act, 2011. Under Article 252(1) (b) of the Constitution, the
             Commission has the powers necessary for conciliation, mediation and negotiation. Further, Article 59 (h)
             and (i) of the Constitution which is replicated by Section 8 (a) and (b) of the Act grants the Commission
             powers to investigate any conduct of State Officers, or any act or omission in Public Administration that is
             alleged or suspected to be prejudicial or improper, or to result in any impropriety or prejudice. Section 8(h)
             of the Act provides as one of the functions of the Commission to provide Advisory Opinions on proposals on
             improvement of Public Administration.

             Under Section 26(c), the Commission is empowered to adjudicate on matters relating to administrative
             justice. Section 29(c) grants the Commission power to investigate any matter arising from the carrying out
             of an administrative action, upon a complaint to the Commission, or on its own initiative. Under section 2
             (1),the Commission is empowered to deal with a decision made or an Act carried out in public service, or a
             failure to act in discharge of a public duty required of an officer in public service.

             In light of the above Constitutional and Statutory mandate, the Commission, of its own motion invited
             the TJRC Chair Amb. Bethuel Kiplagat and the TJRC Commissioners, for a mediation process. Owing to
             reluctance by some of the parties, the mediation process did not achieve fruition, and the Commission
             therefore elected to consider the matters and render an Advisory Opinion.

             At the outset, we wish to state that we have duly warned ourselves that certain aspects of this matter
             have been the subject of judicial proceedings, and have taken due regard of such pronouncements. It
             is important to note that this opinion is not a result of investigations conducted by the Commission.
             In any event the matters that were before the Courts have been concluded and the issues that fell for
             determination have been determined. This Opinion is therefore picking up from the resultant effect of
             the judicial decisions in so far as it relates to Administrative Justice and Public Administration and to offer
             possible avenues for completion of the TJRC tasks without interferences with the Courts’ Orders.

             The TJRC is a Statutory Commission established by the Truth Justice and Reconciliation Act, Act No. 6
             of 2008 (The TJRC Act). The TJRC Act was enacted after considering the fact that there have been gross
             violations of human rights, abuse of power and misuse of public office, and that there was need to give the
             people of Kenya a fresh start where justice is accorded to the victims of injustice and past transgressions.
             The framers of the TJRC Act were conscious of the fact that some of the transgressions against the Kenyan
             people could not be properly addressed by our judicial institutions due to procedural and legal hindrances.
             The Commissioners of the TJRC were duly appointed in accordance with the relevant provisions of the
             TJRC Act and no issues arose as to the suitability of any of the Commissioners at the time. Thereafter, an
             issue arose as to the suitability and/or credibility of the Chairperson of the TJRC continuing to serve as
             such. The dispute ended up in Court through Misc. App No. 470 of 2009 Republic vs. Truth, Justice and
             Reconciliation Commission and another Ex-parte Njeru Kathangu and 9 Others. In this suit the ex-parte
             Applicants alleged that:




214          REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION
                                                                                                      Vol u m e I   APPENDICES




a)	   Amb. Bethuel Kiplagat was unfit to be appointed as a Commissioner and Chairman of the TJRC on
      account of his past record as he was alleged to have been involved in defending torture, abuse of
      judicial process and policies of dictatorship in Kenya during the period he served as a diplomat and as
      the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

b)	   the TJRC Act specifically excluded holders of public office, both serving and retired, from membership
      of the TJRC because the actions of public officers are the subject of the investigations being undertaken
      by the TJRC and therefore the forwarding of the TJRC chair’s name for appointment to the TJRC was
      therefore against the spirit and letter of the TJRC Act.

c)	   the Oath of Office taken by the TJRC Chair was null and void as it was taken before publication of the
      notice of his appointment in the Kenya Gazzette .

In short, the Applicants were questioning the recommendation by the Selection Panel and nomination
of Amb. Bethwel Kiplagat for appointment as Commissioner and Chairman of the TJRC. These allegations
were also supported by a section of members of the public including a section of the civil society who
questioned the suitability of the TJRC Chair to continue as such.

The Applicants sought an order of Certiorari, to quash the “Oath of Office” of Amb. Bethuel Kiplagat
on account that it was irregularly administered and that the Selection Panel that proposed his name
for appointment was not properly constituted. The Applicants contended that the Chief Justice had
administered to the Chairman of the TJRC the oath of office on 3rd August 2009 before the appointment
or publication on the 14th August 2009 which was done vide Gazette Notice Number 8737, and therefore
it was irregular and called for questioning.

The Court found that according to the Gazette Notice, the appointment was made on the 22nd July 2009
before the oath of office was administered and it was only the publication that was done on the 14th
August 2009 and therefore declined to grand the order of Certiorari by holding that “there was nothing
wrong with the publication of the notice of appointment after administrating the oath”. It was also found
that the selection panel was properly constituted.

The second prayer sought was that of prohibition, to prohibit Amb. Bethuel Kiplagat from running the
offices of the TJRC as Chairman or participation in any way in the affairs of the TJRC. The Court looked at
the jurisprudence that informs the issuance of such an order of prohibition, and found that the remedy
of prohibition as sought by the Applicants was not available to them. The Application was dismissed with
costs on the 28th November 2011.

As this matter was pending litigation, Amb. Kiplagat had joined the other Commissioners and signed a
letter requesting the establishment of a tribunal to investigate the allegations against him. This was done
on the 12th of April 2010 through a unanimous decision by TJRC. On 10th December 2010, the Chief
Justice appointed a tribunal under Gazette Notice Number 15894 to investigate the conduct of the TJRC
Chairperson, including, but not limited to, the allegations that his past conduct eroded and compromised
his legitimacy and credibility to chair the TJRC.

Amb. Kiplagat had, on 2nd November 2010 released a signed media statement welcoming the decision
of the Chief Justice to appoint a tribunal. After the appointment of the tribunal, Amb. Kiplagat filed an
application before the tribunal challenging its jurisdiction to investigate his past conduct. The motion was
however found by the tribunal to be fatally defective and incompetent and was struck out. The tribunal
also found that it had jurisdiction to inquire into the past conduct of Amb. Kiplagat. He then moved to
the High Court and filed HC Misc. Civil Application NO. 95 of 2011 Bethwel Kiplagat Vs. The Chief Justice
and Others and sought to challenge the proceedings of the tribunal by way of Judicial Review. The matter




                                   REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION                             215

             came before His Lordship Justice Muchelule to determine whether to grant Leave, and whether the Leave
             granted to institute the proceedings should operate as a Stay of the proceedings before the tribunal. The
             Judge held that the Leave should operate as a stay after taking into account the matters that the tribunal
             was going to investigate. Nonetheless, the Judge did make some observations obiter, which we shall make
             reference to later in this Opinion.

             This matter was however withdrawn by Amb. Kiplagat on the 1st day of December 2011. In the meantime,
             the tribunal’s timeline had expired before it had released its report which prompted the TJRC to institute JR
             Case No. 7 of 2012 The Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission Vs. The Chief Justice of the Republic
             of Kenya and Bethwel Kiplagat. The Applicant sought an Order of Mandamus compelling the Chief Justice
             to appoint a tribunal pursuant to Section 17 (2) of the TJRC Act. In the alternative, they sought an Order of
             Mandamus compelling the Chief Justice to reconstitute the tribunal appointed on 2nd December 2010 and
             an Order of Prohibition to prohibit/restrain Amb. Kiplagat from acting and or resuming office as Chairman
             and Commissioner of TJRC and/or entering the offices of TJRC. It is important to note that at this point
             Amb. Kiplagat had since ‘‘stepped aside’’.

              In a lengthy and reasoned ruling delivered on 24th December 2012, His Lordship Justice Warsame
             determined that the TJRC had no legal capacity or authority to bring the present application against
             Amb. Kiplagat. The judge also held that much as a member of the TJRC may be removed from office
             for misbehavior or misconduct, the misbehaviour or misconduct must have arisen at the time the
             Commissioner or Chairman was in office. On the pertinent question before the court, the judge held that
             there is no statutory power imposed upon the Chief Justice of the Republic of Kenya to appoint a tribunal
             to investigate and inquire into the past conduct of the TJRC Chair or any other Commissioner. He also held
             that the former Chief Justice had no powers, authority and/or jurisdiction to appoint a tribunal to inquire
             into the past conduct of the Chair of TJRC. He went ahead to dismiss the Application with costs against
             TJRC, which costs were to be borne by the Commissioners personally.

             It is clear from this rather sad and unfortunate history of the TJRC that the allegations levelled against
             Amb. Kiplagat were never determined upon their merits. Indeed Justice Warsame after castigating TJRC
             Commissioners for filing the Application which he considered frivolous nonetheless observed at Page 32
             of his ruling that “none of the allegations have been considered, investigated and determined”. But it is
             equally clear that those allegations, insofaras they relate to alleged conduct before appointment, cannot
             be legally used to bar Amb. Kiplagat from occupying the office of chair to the Commission.

             After the aforementioned Ruling, Amb. Kiplagat returned to office to conduct his duties as the Chair of
             TJRC. He did not get a warm and generous reception from the rest of the Commissioners resulting in a
             standoff between the two. The other Commissioners were of the view that since the matters against Amb.
             Kiplagat had never been determined upon their merits, he could not sit and participate in the preparation
             and pronouncement of the TJRC Report.

             Following this stalemate, the Commission, wearing its conciliation hat, sought to provide a forum for
             mediation between the two parties. Amb. Kiplagat attended to the Commission’s offices on the 5th March
             2012 and in a lengthy discussion lasting almost three hours gave his points of view of the whole matter. He
             agreed in the said meeting, to a reconciliation and mediation process to be steered by the Commission.

             The other Commissioners of TJRC were also invited to a meeting with the Commission on the 6th March
             2012. They elected to send the Chief Executive Officer, Mrs. Patricia Nyaundi who, after explaining that the
             Commissioners sent apologies as they were having formal hearings, also gave an account of the position
             as Viewed by the TJRC Commissioners. What followed were formal letters from the Commission dated 6th
             March 2012 addressed to Amb. Kiplagat and the Chief Executive Officer of TJRC, seeking formal concurrence
             of both Amb. Kiplagat and the other Commissioners to a mediation process. On the 14thMarch 2012,




216          REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION
                                                                                                       Vol u m e I   APPENDICES




the Commission received a letter dated 12th March 2012 from the Chief Executive Officer of TJRC Mrs.
Patricia Nyaundi informing the CAJ that the other Commissioners were consulting on the contents of the
Commission’s letter of 6th March 2012 and would as soon as possible revert to the Commission. The
Commission has since not received further communication from her. On his part, Amb. Kiplagat called
the Commission’s offices on the 9th March 2012 and politely declined engaging in any further processes
concerning the matter since, he noted, he was now settled in the TJRC offices and therefore saw no need
of engaging in the mediation intended by the Commission.

In light of the commission’s powers and functions as already highlighted, and in view of the clear reluctance
to engage in mediation by the parties, the Commission elected to switch from its mediative role under
Section 8(f), 26 (c) and 29(2) to its Advisory role under section 8 (h) of the Commission on Administrative
Justice Act 2011. Thus, to the extent that Amb. Kiplagat moved to resume office on the one hand, while the
rest of Commissioners are determined to thwart his move on the other hand, these constitute “action” and
“omission” respectively as defined in Section 2 (1) (a) and (b) of the Act. In the interests of the country, the
Commission thus proceeds to render this Advisory Opinion as mandated by law.

The Commission has with abundant caution and care, considered the facts relating to this matter and the
effect that the continuing stalemate would have on the integrity of the TJRC report due to be released. We
have also carefully analyzed the judicial pronouncements that have been made concerning some aspects of
this matter. Nonetheless, whilst the Commission respects the decision of the Courts and concurs with the
basis of the decision therein, the same do not preclude the Commission from making its Recommendations
from the perspective of public administration.

It is our view that the cumulative Court interventions have blurred the determination of a very important
question, namely, whether Amb. Kiplagat, in light of the allegations levelled against him concerning his past
conduct, is suitable to hold office as Commissioner and Chair of TJRC. The judicial pronouncements while
sound in law, have effectively stopped inquiry and determination of the said question. Indeed, the law is
clear and the Court is right on the question of which period the tribunal may investigate the conduct of the
Chairperson. It cannot be the period prior to the enactment of the TJRC Act and before his appointment.
However, the Integrity of the outcome of the TJRC’s report must be protected and guarded in view of the
enormous task that has been granted to the TJRC.

In our view, the contest is one between Legality and Integrity. While the legality favours the return of the
Amb. Kiplagat to TJRC, it is up to the Commission itself to protect the integrity of the process. The question
as to whether Amb. Kiplagat should participate in the remaining process of TJRC is a question not of legality
but of integrity. What effect would he have on the integrity of the report if he substantively participated
in its preparation?

The question is not about who is right in law but what effect his participation is going to have on the
strength of the report? We reiterate and agree with the observations that had been made much earlier by
Justice Muchelule in HC Misc. No.95 of 2011 which we quote below in extenso;

“For me, the applicant is faced with a serious moral issue. His appointment was on the basis that his
conduct, character and integrity were beyond reproach, and that he was going to be an impartial
arbiter in whatever proceedings that were going to be conducted by him. It was expected that he was
not involved, implicated, linked or associated with human rights violations of any kind or in any matter
which the Commission is supposed to investigate. But now, he is faced with a situation where his past has
allegedly been dug out and his own Commission may very well be seeking to investigate him. The issue is
not whether the allegations being levelled against him are true. What is material is that the Commission
will want to investigate the circumstances surrounding the death of Robert Ouko, the Wagalla Massacre
and the Ndung’u Report on illegal/irregular allocation of public land and in each case he is being adversely




                                   REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION                              217
Volume I   APPENDICES




             mentioned. He cannot sit in judgement when the issues are being discussed. Justice will cry if he were
             allowed to sit in judgment, be a witness and an accused, all that the same time. My advise is that he should
             do the honourable thing”.

             We agree fully that Amb. Kiplagat cannot be a judge in his own cause. We further observe that Amb.
             Kiplagat falls on the right side of the Law but on the wrong side of Integrity.
             We therefore advise as follows:

                1.	 That Amb. Bethuel Kiplagat should be allowed to return and sit in his office in accordance with the
                    Court Orders.

                2.	 That having assessed the time left within which the TJRC is required to prepare and submit its
                    report vis a vis the time it would take for any appeal filed by the TJRC to be determined, it would
                    be ill advised for the TJRC Commissioners to believe that such determination will be made in time
                    before preparation of their Report.

                3.	 That Amb. Bethuel Kiplagat should not participate or interfere with the preparation of the TJRC
                    report since such participation may have a negative effect to the acceptance of the Report. He
                    should however be given an opportunity to review the report within a short time and to script an
                    addendum to the report wherein he may agree or give his dissenting opinion. This is precented.
                    In the Report of the Independent Electoral Review Commission (IREC or Kieggler Commission),
                    two Commissioners duly expressed their dissent, and reasons thereof, which was included as an
                    addendum to the report.

                4.	 That Amb. Kiplagat be paid the entire difference in salary for the period in which he had stepped
                    aside since he was on half salary.

                5.	 Amb.Bethuel Kiplagat should however, in a show of good faith, waive the costs that had been
                    granted to him by the Courts in the judicial processes between him and TJRC. Indeed, Amb. Kiplagat
                    had indicated to the Commission that he was not keen in pursuing the costs granted to him by the
                    Courts and only wanted reconciliation. If, however, he should elect not to do so, it would be worth
                    pursuing an Appeal in light of S.32 of the TJRC Act which grants immunity from personal liability

                6.	 It has also not escaped our attention that the afflictions in TJRC have also been the subject of
                    political interference. A threat by a section of Rift Valley Members of Parliament to reject the
                    report of the TJRC if Amb. Kiplagat is excluded in the remaining process is unfortunate since it
                    demonstrates sectarian support which ultimately undermines Amb. Kiplagat’s authority. Seeking
                    sectarian support by Amb. Kiplagat or any of the Commissioners, will only seek to erode the
                    integrity of the Report.

             We do observe that the hardships experienced by the TJRC have struck a sad and solemn note in public
             administration in Kenya. It is ironical that the very institution established to achieve lasting peace and
             harmonious co-existence among Kenyans, by providing for them a forum to discuss such matters freely
             and in a reconciliatory manner, should be the same one engulfed in wrangles. We believe the TJRC
             Commissioners have the courage, wisdom and ability to pull through this task, and we invite them to do so.

•	   The Commissioners are concerned about the conflicts of interest presented by Ambassador Kiplagat.
          o	 Ambassador Kiplagat was present at a meeting of the Kenya Intelligence Committee in Wajir two
             days before the start of what became known as the Wagalla Massacre;
          o	 Ambassador Kiplagat was an important witness to events leading up to the assassination of
             the Honorable Robert Ouko, and was recommended for further investigation and noted as an
             uncooperative witness by previous inquiries into that assassination;
          o	 Ambassador Kiplagat has admitted to having been involved in land transactions that were labeled
             by the Ndung’u Commission of Inquiry as irregular and illegal.

•	   The Commissioners are also concerned that Ambassador Kiplagat swore under oath before the panel that
     selected the Commissioners that he “has not in any way been involved, implicated, linked, or associated with
     human rights violations of any kind or in any matter which is to be investigated” by the Commission. (See
     Section 10(6)(b) of the Act.)
•	   The Commission is required by its mandate to investigate all three of the areas listed above in which
     Ambassador Kiplagat is involved or linked: massacres, political assassinations, and irregular and illegal land
     transactions.
•	   All three of the areas listed above have been the subject of numerous statements and memoranda to the
     Commission, and many of these statements (over three dozen) have specifically mentioned Ambassador
     Kiplagat as linked to these and other violations within the mandate of the Commission.
•	   The Commissioners are united in the position that the conflicts of issue raised by Ambassador Kiplagat need
     to be addressed in a credible and transparent process that is consistent with the rule of law.


     History
•	   The Commissioners, including Ambassador Kiplagat, with the assistance of an external facilitator and mediator,
     engaged in a series of internal consultations from February to April 2010 to come up with a mechanism to
     address the conflicts of interest of Ambassador Kiplagat.
•	   After much discussion and consultation, Ambassador Kiplagat insisted that the only proper mechanism to
     address the issues raised by his presence was a tribunal established pursuant to Section 17 of the Act. The
     other Commissioners agreed with this approach, and all nine Commissioners, including Ambassador Kiplagat,
     agreed in writing that the Commission would request such a tribunal and that Ambassador Kiplagat would
     step aside until such a tribunal had finished its work.
•	   The Commissioners filed a petition with the Chief Justice in April 2010 asking that a tribunal be established
     to determine if Ambassador Kiplagat had engaged in “misbehavior or misconduct” under the Act by signing
     a false affidavit claiming that he had no involvement with matters to be investigated by the Commission and
     by continuing to privately and publicly claim that he was not involved with any matter to be investigated by
     the Commission.
•	   At the time the Commission submitted its petition Ambassador Kiplagat had already changed his position
     on the meeting in Wajir, first asserting that he had never been to Wajir in his life, and then claiming that he
     did not remember if he had attended a meeting in Wajir or not. Since the filing of the petition Ambassador

           Kiplagat has been reminded by others that he had in fact been present at a meeting in Wajir two days before
           the start of the Wagalla Massacre. Having been reminded of his presence, Ambassador Kiplagat now asserts
           confidently that no security operation was discussed in the meeting he attended over 27 years ago.
      •	   The Chief Justice announced the establishment of a tribunal in October 2010.
      •	   The Chief Justice in exercising his proper legal authority under the Act adopted an interpretation of the phrase
           “misbehavior or misconduct” that was broader than that asserted by the Commissioners in the petition, and
           created a tribunal to look into issues of integrity and credibility throughout Ambassador Kiplagat’s life.
      •	   A three judge tribunal began its work in earnest in December 2010 following the “stepping aside” by Amb.
           Kiplagat.
      •	   While Ambassador Kiplagat first welcomed the creation of the tribunal as a forum before which he could
           assert his innocence, Amb. Kiplagat filed a challenge before the tribunal questioning its jurisdiction.
      •	   The tribunal rejected Ambassador Kiplagat’s challenge and continued with its work.
      •	   Ambassador Kiplagat then went to the High Court to challenge the jurisdiction of the tribunal. The High Court
           granted a temporary stay of the proceedings of the tribunal so that Ambassador Kiplagat’s arguments could
           be heard without prejudice.
      •	   While Ambassador Kiplagat pursued his matter in the High Court, the life of the tribunal expired in April 2011.
      •	   The tribunal never had an opportunity to finish its work, and thus did not rule either in favor or against
           Ambassador Kiplagat.
      •	   In November 2011 Ambassador Kiplagat withdrew his case before the High Court before the Court could
           reach a decision.
      •	   The High Court never ruled on Ambassador Kiplagat’s challenge to the legality of the creation of the tribunal.
      •	   A group of former MPs brought a case in the High Court in August 2009 challenging, inter alia, the creation
           of the TJRC and the selection of all of the Commissioners. Ambassador Kiplagat retained separate counsel
           in that case, and argued that the only proper procedure for questioning the appointment of a Commissioner
           was through a tribunal under Section 17 of the Act.
      •	   The High Court dismissed the challenge brought by the former MPs, and in its opinion noted that the proper
           avenue for challenging the presence of a Commissioner was found in Section 17 of the Act.
      •	   In January 2012 Ambassador Kiplagat returned unannounced to the TJRC offices asserting that he had been
           “cleared” by the courts.
      •	   The Commission requested that Ambassador Kiplagat honor the pledge he made to the people of Kenya and
           to the Commission that he would step aside until the tribunal finished its work.
      •	   Ambassador Kiplagat rejected the appeal of his fellow Commissioners and insisted, contrary to the history of
           the court proceedings, that he had been cleared by the courts.
      •	   The Commissioners went to the High Court to, inter alia, enjoin Ambassador Kiplagat from returning to the
           TJRC unless and until a tribunal addressed the issues raised in the Commission’s petition.
      •	   Judge Warswame of the High Court in his decision noted that no process had yet been completed concerning
           the issues raised in the Commission’s petition, yet the learned judge nevertheless ruled against the Commission
           before providing the Commission an opportunity to argue the merits of the matter.

           Current Situation and Way Forward
      •	   The Commission has appealed the decision of Judge Warswame.
      •	   Ambassador Kiplagat has now returned to the TJRC. The CEO vacated her office in order to provide Ambassador
           Kiplagat with an office.
      •	   The Commissioners met with Ambassador Kiplagat on 30 March 2012. At that meeting the Commissioners
           reiterated to Ambassador Kiplagat that the differences with him were not of a personal nature, but were
           differences based on principle. The Commissioners explained that the issues involved the integrity of the TJRC

                                                                                                   Vol u m e I     APPENDICES




     process, including the final report, and the conflicts of interest presented by Ambassador Kiplagat in three areas
     within the mandate of the Commission.
•	   The Commissioners expressed disappointment that the conflicts of interest raised by Ambassador Kiplagat
     had yet to be addressed, and asked Ambassador Kiplagat to honor the pledge he made to the Commission
     and the people of Kenya in November 2010 – viz., that he would graciously stand aside while his conflicts of
     interest were addressed by a tribunal set up under our Act.
•	   The Commissioners concluded by noting that until a process addressing Ambassador Kiplagat’s conflicts of
     interest was concluded, the Commissioners would continue to be reluctant to work with him.
•	   The Commissioners exchanged views with Ag. PS Mr. Kibara on April 3rd 2012 on the possibility of involving
     Ambassador Kiplagat in the remaining phase of the TJRC work, in particular the review and approval of the
     Commission’s final report.
•	   In the meeting with the Ag. PS the Commissioners reiterated that the issues we have with Ambassador
     Kiplagat are not of a personal nature, but concern issues of principle and the integrity and credibility of the
     TJRC process.
•	   The Commissioners noted that allegations linking Commissioner Farah to matters to be investigated by the
     Commission were raised. The Commission, with the full cooperation of Commissioner Farah, investigated
     those allegations and found clear and convincing evidence absolving Commissioner Farah of the allegations.
     Commissioner Farah declined to request a tribunal pursuant to Section 17 of our Act.
•	   The Commissioners are of the view that the following could be the basis of such involvement:
          1)	 Ambassador Kiplagat will review drafts of the final report in the same manner and at the same time
              as other Commissioners. The final report is being prepared by a technical team of experts under the
              supervision of a committee of the Commission. Once a draft of the report is ready, Commissioners
              will be given an opportunity to review and comment on the draft. The technical team will then
              redraft the report taking into account the comments of the Commissioners.
          2)	 Ambassador Kiplagat will not be allowed to review those sections of the report that concern areas
              in which he has a conflict of interest, including those parts of the report concerning massacres,
              political assassinations, and land. Ambassador Kiplagat will be given the same rights and
              opportunities as any other adversely mentioned person. Thus if the report includes an adverse
              finding concerning Ambassador Kiplagat, he will be given the same opportunity as other adversely
              mentioned individuals to respond to that finding and to have his response taken into account in the
              final drafting of that finding.
          3)	 Ambassador Kiplagat has refused to honor a summons to testify before the Commission. He is the
              only person to date who has so refused a summons. Unless Ambassador Kiplagat agrees to testify
              before the Commission pursuant to this summons, the Commission reserves the right to pursue
              legal enforcement of its summons as provided for under Section 7(6) of the Act.
          4)	 Ambassador Kiplagat must agree to comply with the decision-making processes of the Commission
              set forth in the Act and as established by resolutions of the Commission. The Commission
              has operated successfully for over fifteen months with these procedures, and all of the other
              Commissioners to date have abided by them.
