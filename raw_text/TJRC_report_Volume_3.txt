Foreword

This volume builds upon the previous volumes analysis of the past to begin to point the
way forward for national unity, healing and reconciliation. One cannot speak of national
unity, healing and reconciliation without discussing ethnic tension. The causes of ethnic
tension, and the problems raised by ethnic tension, have been discussed in other parts of
this Report. In particular the chapter on ethnic tension should be read together with the
chapter on Economic Marginalization and Violations of Socio-Economic Rights.

Ethnic tensions, particularly the tendency to view people who are different as ‘the other’
and thus not identify with, and either fear or scapegoat them, is unfortunately as old as
human history. Tracing the origins of ethnic tension in Kenya to the beginning of history
was beyond the scope of the Commission’s work. To understand the continued presence
of ethnic tension today, and its evolution during our mandate period, we started with the
colonial period, for it was under the colonial power that the political entity today known
as Kenya was formed. In discussing ethnic tension since independence, we look at state
and non-state actors, including the role of culture and stereotypes. Any discussion of
ethnic tension in present-day Kenya would be incomplete without a discussion of the
relationship between ethnicity and politics. It is an unfortunate fact that who joins a
political party, and which politicians or parties form alliances, can be more often explained
by ethnicity over any other factor. It is this potent, and at times volatile, combination of
ethnicity and politics that has unfortunately spiralled into ethnic violence far too many
times in our history.

While ethnicity and ethnic tension are discussed throughout the Report, we include here
a case study on Mt. Elgon to provide a deeper analysis of the history of ethnicity in Kenya
and its relationship to politics, land, and violence. The Mt. Elgon case study is unique
because of the peculiar mix of ethnicity in the region, and the fact that ethnic tensions
gave rise to a well-organized militia that terrorized the local population, which in turn
led the state to engage in a military operation to stop the militia, but which also resulted
in additional violations of the local population. Yet, the story of Mt. Elgon is typical in
that it combines aspects of historical injustices that the Commission had seen in many
other parts of the country. Firstly, the use of ethnicity to divide a local community and
the combining of ethnic tension with disputes over land. Secondly, ethnic tension over
land and identity spilling over into overt violence. Thirdly, the creation of organized
militia groups to harden tensions based upon land and ethnicity. Fourthly, the influence
of all of these forces on the political dynamics of the region, underscored by the role that

             politicians have and continue to play with respect to ethnic tension, land, militias, and
             other violence. Finally, the intervention of the state to combat the militia groups and to
             protect the local population resulting in further violations.

             While much of this volume is devoted to understanding the wide variety of historical
             injustices committed during the mandate period, we combined here a discussion of
             ethnicity and ethnic tension with national unity and reconciliation as, at the end of the
             day, they both involve a focus on the individual, the family and the community. It is,
             in short, a focus on the people of Kenya. And it is the people of Kenya, who have both
             committed and suffered these violations, who ultimately are the key to national unity and
             reconciliation.

             National unity and reconciliation are properly understood as both a goal and a process.
             They are ideal states to which we as a nation must strive, and they require constant effort
             and attention. The same may be said of healing. An individual is never completely healed
             from a tragedy. If our expectation is complete healing, as though the tragedy had not
             occurred, then we are setting ourselves up for failure. Similarly, if we set national unity
             and reconciliation among all peoples as our benchmark of success, then we will never
             succeed. But if we set our benchmark as working towards and increasing national unity
             and reconciliation, just as we work to heal an individual who has suffered a tragedy, then
             we can set clear interim goals, plans, and other strategies by which we can then measure
             progress.

             Efforts at national unity and reconciliation began before the Commission started its
             work, and will continue after this Report is issued. National unity and reconciliation were
             furthered by the National Accord that brought an immediate end to the violence arising
             from the 2007 election. But one can go back to the founding of the nation, in 1963, to
             find the first efforts to create a nation of people who view themselves first as Kenyan. It
             is a process that even after half a century is still incomplete. The Commission was under
             no illusion that it could achieve something that had not yet been achieved after fifty
             years of nationhood. We hope, however, that we are able to provide a more accurate and
             current picture of the state of national unity and reconciliation in Kenya today; that the
             efforts we undertook to further reconciliation in many communities across the nation
             will bear fruit as those communities continue to work through the legacy of historical
             injustices; and that the structures that are already in place to further reconciliation will
             gain strength, and perhaps hope, from the work we have done in furthering national
             unity and reconciliation.

Volume III   Chapter ONE




             Introduction
             1.	       A critical challenge that Kenya has faced since attaining independence in 1963
                       is the integration of its different ethnic groups or communities into a cohesive
                       nation, without compromising the respective distinct identities of these ethnic
                       groups. Over the years, ethnicity has become an instrument of division. Some
                       parts of the country have experienced heightened levels of ethnic tension which
                       have resulted in violence. The 2007/2008 Post-Election Violence (PEV) which
                       prompted the creation of the Commission is perhaps the worst, but not the only,
                       example of violence resulting from, amongst other reasons, long standing ethnic
                       tension between ethnic groups in the country.

             2.	       Although the problem of ethnic tension and violence has long been acknowledged,
                       it was not until the aftermath of the 2007/2008 PEV that robust efforts to address the
                       problem began to take shape. Earlier efforts to address the problem ended neither
                       in fundamental changes in ethnic relations nor prevention of ethnic violence. For
                       instance, in the aftermath of the 1991/1992 ethnic clashes, the National Assembly
                       established a Parliamentary Select Committee to Investigate Ethnic Clashes in
                       Western Kenya and Other Parts of Kenya. It was mandated to investigate the root
                       cause of the clashes, identify persons who might have perpetrated or participated
                       in the clashes and make recommendations that would help to avert such clashes in
                       the future. The 13 member Committee, chaired by the then Changamwe Member
                       of Parliament, Kennedy Kiliku, commenced its work on 14 May 1992 and submitted
                       its report (commonly referred to as Kiliku report) to Parliament in September 1992.
                       The recommendations of the Committee were ignored, and not surprisingly, ethnic
                       clashes were again witnessed in the period running to and during the 1997 General
                       Elections.

             3.	       In response to the 1997 ethnic clashes, the government established the Judicial
                       Commission of Inquiry into Tribal Clashes in Kenya (commonly referred to as
                       Akiwumi Commission).3 It was mandated to investigate the tribal clashes that had
                       occurred in various parts of the country from 1991, with a view of establishing or
                       determining, inter alia, ‘the origin, the probable, the immediate and the underlying
                       causes of such clashes’. The Akiwumi Commission carried out investigations
                       between 14 July 1998 and 11 June 1999. It submitted its report to the President in
                       August 1999 but the report was not released to the public until towards the end of
                       2002, when the High Court ordered its release.4 Indeed, the government not only
                       delayed the release of the Akiwumi Report for a span of around three years, but it
                       also ignored and contested the findings of the Commission.

4.	      Thus, although the government had as early as 1992 acknowledged that ethnic
         tension was rife in the country it did not take adequate measures to address the
         issue. The impact of this failure would, coupled with other factors, contribute to the
         vicious and large scale violence that took place in the country following the disputed
         presidential election of 27 December 2007. The violence had a distinct ethnic
         dimension. Therefore, with 1,133 people dead, and more than 350,000 internally
         displaced during the PEV, the phenomenon of ethnic tension could not be ignored
         anymore.

5.	      As such, addressing the question of ethnic tension and violence was top in the
         agenda of the Kenya National Dialogue and Reconciliation. The NCIC and this
         Commission were established with complementary roles in dealing with the
         problem of ethnic tension.

6.	      For this reason, section 6(s) of the TJR Act mandated the Commission to ‘inquire
         into the causes of ethnic tension and make recommendations on the promotion of
         healing, reconciliation and coexistence among ethnic communities’.

7.	      This Chapter documents the main causes and effects of ethnic tension in
         Kenya. The chapter is based mainly on testimonies that the Commission heard
         during its hearings across the country. In addition to holding such hearings, the
         Commission also organized a thematic hearing on ethnic tension and violence on
         2 February 2012 in Nairobi. During this thematic hearing the Commission heard
         presentations by experts and relevant institutions such as: the National Cohesion
         and Integration Commission (NCIC). The objective of the thematic hearing was
         well summarized by Commissioner Berhanu Dinka during the opening of the
         hearing. He said:
             In the last ten months, the Commission has travelled the length and breadth of this
             country. We have listened to testimonies of victims and witnesses of ethnic clashes and
             political or electoral violence. The stories are sad and revealing. Today, the thematic
             hearing seeks to further interrogate the issue of ethnicity and its nexus with violence,
             governance, political transition and distribution of resources.5

8.	      This Chapter should be read together with two other Chapters contained in
         this Report: The Chapter on ‘Economic Marginalisation and Violations of Socio-
         Economic Rights’ which deals in great detail with the nexus between ethnic
         relations and economic marginalisation; and the Chapter on Land and conflict
         which deals in great details with the nexus between ethnic relations and land
         relate grievances. The next Chapter in this Volume focuses on a case study of the
         intersection between ethnic relations, land and politics.

             Definitions
             9.	       In this Chapter, ethnic group refers to a group of person defined by reference to colour,
                       race, religion, or ethnic or national origins.6 The term ‘tribe’ is also sometimes used in
                       common parlance, but it is considered derogatory.7 The term has a connotation to
                       colonialism and ideas of African traditionalism and backwardness in opposition to
                       white or European civilization. Therefore, the Commission does not use this term,
                       except when quoting witnesses verbatim.

             10.	      Ethnicity may be used as a vehicle for positive group identification, or for negative
                       exclusion including discrimination and, in extreme cases, ethnically-motivated
                       violence. Kenya’s history is replete with examples of ethnicity used for both positive
                       and negative purposes. While this chapter focuses on the negative side of ethnicity
                       as required by the Commission’s mandate, it is important to acknowledge that ethnic
                       affiliation is not, in and of itself, a bad thing. In fact, ethnicity is often at the core of
                       an individual’s sense of identity and belonging. In an environment of tolerance and
                       celebration of diversity, ethnicity can strengthen national identity and purpose.

             11.	      Ethnic tension refers to protracted social and political confrontations between
                       ethnic groups.8 Such confrontations may be physical or non-physical in nature.
                       Ethnic tension is also referred to as ‘ethnic conflict’, and both terms are used
                       interchangeably in this Chapter. Such confrontations may either be physical or
                       non-physical in nature. ‘Ethnic violence or clashes’, also a commonly used term
                       in Kenya, refers to physical violence that arises from, or is motivated by, ethnic
                       tension.

             12.	      The terms ‘ethnic violence’, ‘ethnic tension,’ and ‘ethnic conflict’ are often used
                       interchangeably. This Chapter distinguishes ethnic violence as an aggravated form
                       of ethnic tension or conflict that results in physical violence or even armed conflict.
                       Ordinarily, ethnic tension precedes the occurrence of ethnic violence. Ethnic tension
                       may also continue in the aftermath of ethnic violence.

             13.	      Ethnic tension does not result from the mere co-existence of multi-ethnic groups
                       within a nation.9 Rather, ethnic conflict and ethnic violence often arise from socio-
                       economic and political tension between or within the various ethnic communities
                       which are then manipulated by politicians or other leaders to further a selfish
                       political or economic agenda. In Kenya, ethnicity has become an instrument of
                       division. Consequently, parts of the country have experienced heightened levels of

         violence that led to the creation of this Commission is perhaps the worst, but not
         the only, example of ethnic tension erupting into ethnic violence through political
         manipulation.

Ethnic Composition
14.	     Kenya is a multi-ethnic country. Following the adoption of a new Constitution in
         August 2010, the country has been geographically and administratively divided
         into 47 counties. Previously the country was divided into eight provinces and
         210 districts. With the current population of approximately 41 million people, the
         country is inhabited by more than 44 ethnic communities from the Bantu, Nilotic
         and Cushitic peoples. The country’s population also comprises people of Arabic,
         Asian and European origin. The 2010 Population and Housing Census Report include
         the most recent data on ethnicity, which is set forth in Table 1 and Figure 1.

             Causes of Ethnic Tension
             Colonial origins
             15.	     The origin of Kenya as presently constituted can be traced back to 1895 when the
                      British East Africa Protectorate was established.12 Prior to that, every community
                      that lived in the territory now called Kenya existed as a discrete unit according
                      to its own respective socio-political arrangements, governing itself by its own
                      customary laws and traditions.13 This is true not just of Kenya but of many pre-
                      colonial societies in Africa.

             16.	     Pre-colonial Africa consisted of two categories of societies. The first category had
                      centralised authority, administrative machinery, and standing judicial institutions,
                      while the second had communal and less intrusive governmental paraphernalia.
                      These differences notwithstanding, the majority of pre-colonial African societies

6            REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION
                                                                                       Vol u m e III   Chapter ONE




          characteristically displayed ethnic, cultural, and linguistic homogeneity, as well as
          fundamental cohesion.

17.	      Foreign intrusion – notably slave trade and colonialism – led to the decline
          and subsequent demise of many of the social and communal values that had
          defined African societies. With the introduction of Arab slave traders and
          European colonialists, African customary practices that essentially promoted
          homogeneity no longer evolved according to African needs.

18.	      The weapons of Africans at the time (spears, bows, and arrows) were inadequate
          against the more destructive weapons of the foreign intruders. Consequently,
          African societies were easily dominated politically, economically, and socially and
          their social structures and cultures were either ignored or replaced with foreign ones.
          For the administrative convenience of the colonial rulers, the disparate traditional
          communities were forcibly cobbled together to form a single large territorial entity.
          It was in this fashion that most of the colonial African states, including Kenya, were
          formed and developed over the years.

Divide and rule policy
19.	      The colonial government pursued a policy of ‘divide and rule’ in order to consolidate
          their hold on the country, and to lessen the possibility that the African population
          would resist colonial rule. To that end, they magnified the differences between the
          various communities and regions, and stereotyped each community in a manner
          that would sow suspicion, hatred and the sense of ‘otherness’.

20.	      In addition, colonial government created ethnically defined administrative boundaries.
          In determining such boundaries, no serious thought, if at all, was given to historical
          inter-ethnic interactions and relations. For instance, the people of what was known
          as Northern Frontier District were divided into two main groups: Somali and Galla
          with each group accorded its own territory. Sub-groups within these two main groups
          were further restricted within specific territorial boundaries. The arbitrary manner in
          which these boundaries were created and the arbitrary nature by which previously
          independent communities were brought within one administrative unit encouraged
          competition for resources and ethnic tension.

21.	      Moreover, the colonial government focused on developing infrastructure and
          social services in productive areas of the country (the so called ‘White Highlands’)
          at the expense of the rest of the country. The resulting inequality remained largely
          unaddressed in the policies and practices of independent Kenya.14 Areas were
14	    As above.




                                REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION                      7
Volume III   Chapter ONE




                       defined productive if they contributed to the economic benefit of the colonial
                       power. Thus, fertile agricultural land and areas important for transporting goods
                       were singled out for infrastructure development. The preferential treatment
                       given to some areas of the country because of their clear productivity thus led
                       to differential treatment of ethnic communities that were patterned around the
                       ethnic enclaves created by the colonial government.

             22.	      It is therefore not surprising that underlying regional imbalances and the attendant
                       inter-ethnic inequalities continue to inform the struggle for the Country’s resources
                       and access to public services. Competition over public resources often takes on an
                       ethnic dimension and contributes to ethnic tension, conflict and violence.

             23.	      The colonial land policy, particularly in the so-called ‘white highlands’ contributed
                       enormously to regional and ethnic marginalisation from the economy. Colonial
                       land policies resulted in displacement, the creation of ‘native reserves’, as well
                       as the movement of masses of population from areas of their habitual residence
                       to completely different regions and settling them on lands that traditionally
                       belonged to other communities. The creation of native reserves ensured that rural
                       areas outside the European domain were demarcated and administered largely
                       as tribal units. The colonial government restricted trade and contact between
                       administrative units

             24.	      By the time Kenya attained independence on 12 December 1963 the colonial
                       power had imposed elements of a modern state structure on communities that
                       historically lacked inter-communal coherence. By forcing ethnic communities that
                       previously lived independent of each other to live together, the British colonisers
                       appeared to be indifferent to the resulting ethnic polarisation. Furthermore,
                       through its policies that favoured the investment of resources only in ‘productive
                       areas’, colonialism encouraged and created the foundation for discriminatory
                       development in Kenya.15

             25.	      During the Commission’s hearings, a leading political science scholar, Professor
                       Walter Oyugi, succinctly summarised this history:
                           Before the British settled in this country, [various ethnic] groups existed. They existed as
                           neighbours and they interacted out of need because there were certain resources which
                           were only available in certain areas. They accessed them through the exchange mechanism.
                           There were also conflicting relationships depending on the culture of the neighbouring
                           groups like cattle rustling especially between the Maasai and the Akamba, the Luo and
                           the Nandis and so on. There was interaction and, therefore occasional rivalry over land,
                           particularly over pasture and water, was common. Later on, this extended to agricultural

8            REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION
                                                                                                Vol u m e III   Chapter ONE




             activities. What would happen with the emergence of the colonial situation? Towards the
             end of 19th Century particularly after the consolidation of British authority around the time
             of World War I, what the British did which contributed to the emergence of consciousness
             of various ethnic groups was the idea of containment. Before colonialism, people were
             moving freely depending on their ability to conquer; but with colonialism, they were now
             confined to a territory. Administrative units were created and there was an association of
             people within an area. Over the years, a sense of feeling that “this is our area” or “this is
             our territory” or “this is our land” developed. Hence, the emergence of Nandi district, Kisii
             district, Kiambu district and so on. So, you are there because of colonial convenience but
             over the years, a consciousness of ownership of that particular asset called land began to
             emerge. Therefore, you begin to see the convergence of territory and ethnic groups. The
             association of certain ethnic groups emerged. For example, Central province belonged to
             Kikuyu, Nyanza for the Luos and Kisii, Western for Luhyas, Rift Valley for KAMATUSA; that is,
             Kalenjin, Maasai, Turkana and Samburu.16 “

26.	     As a result of the ethnic biases that coloured development and land policies
         of the colonial government, Kenya, like many other African countries, entered
         the era of independence with a heightened sense of ethnicity that continued
         to divide rather than unite the country. This ethnocentrism had manifold
         implications. It encouraged the politicisation and manipulation of ethnic
         identities, resulting in the exclusion of some communities from participating
         fully in the core social, economic and political activities of the country.17
         Consequently, one of the most acute problems the country faces is the endless
         struggle to integrate its different communities into a democratic modern nation,
         without compromising their respective ethnic identities.18

27.	     The multiple contradictions left behind by colonial policies on the one hand, and
         the lack of political will and commitment on the part of the ruling political elite
         continued to impact negatively on all efforts at creating a truly democratic and
         prosperous Kenya for all its citizens.

Insider/Outsider dynamics
28.	     Related to the colonial origins of ethnic tensions discussed above is the phenomenon
         of ‘insiders’ and ‘outsiders’. Ethnic tension and violence occur when communities
         assert a superior claim over a territory at the expense of or to the exclusion of
         others. Such superior claims are based on the assumption that ownership or
         occupation at some point in the past created an exclusive claim for such ownership
         or occupation in the present. Often such claims are based on a selective reading of
         history or oral tradition and myths handed down from generation to generation.

                                        REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION                       9
Volume III   Chapter ONE




             39.	 Such exclusive claims to territory inevitably create classes of ‘insiders’ and
                  ‘outsiders’. This perception of people as outsiders as opposed to fellow citizens
                  often lead to increased tension based on ethnicity which, in turn, create the
                  potential for ethnic violence.

             31.	 In the coastal region, members of the Mijikenda community, who regard
                  themselves as indigenes of the coast, view non-Mijikenda individuals such as
                  Kamba, Kikuyu, and Luo who have migrated or settled in the region as ‘outsiders’.
                  The ‘outsiders’ are regarded as ‘wabara’ and are viewed as a people who have
                  unfairly appropriated to themselves local resources, particularly land.

             32.	     There exist perceptions that while the coastal region as a whole has historically
                      been economically marginalized, specific areas within the region that are
                      predominantly occupied by non-Mijikenda are way better in terms of access to
                      infrastructure and access to public services. The Commission heard such views
                      in relation to Mpeketoni Settlement Scheme which is predominantly occupied
                      by members of the Kikuyu ethnic group. According to a witness:
                           You heard about the Bonis. They do not have a road network. If you travel for a distance
                           of less than 100 kilometres you can take 24 hours […] The most hurting thing is that you
                           go up to Kibaoni on the junction going to Mpeketoni settlement scheme the road is so
                           wide and clean that if you are going to Tana River by road you go through Mpeketoni for
                           the sake of you just knowing the terrain and see it for yourself. The bus was zooming as
                           if it was an aircraft on the runway.19

             33.	     A perception exists also that public resources allocated for ‘insiders’ are often
                      diverted to ‘outsiders’ within the region. For instance, a witness testified that while
                      he had lobbied for an ambulance to be allocated to Lamu District Hospital, the
                      same was diverted to Mpeketoni sub-district hospital:
                           I went to the Provincial Director of Medical Health Services. We did everything right.
                           However, when the ambulance came it was taken to Mpeketoni. It was shown as
                           belonging to Lamu District Hospital, but it was sent to Mpeketoni sub-district hospital. I
                           went to the PDA to inquire but I was told it was an order from Nairobi that it be taken to
                           Mpeketoni. There is nothing we could do.20

             34.	     While the Commission could not verify this particular claim, the perception that
                      areas occupied by individuals from outside the region enjoy better services is
                      strongly held amongst coastal locals.

35.	 In the Rift Valley, members of the Kalenjin assert a superior claim over the
     region and view non-Kalenjins resident in the region as foreigners. Indeed, the
     region has been the site of violent ethnic clashes. In particular, during the 1992,
     1997 and 2007 general elections, those considered foreigners were forcefully
     and violently evicted from their farms. This has been particularly the case in
     settlement schemes that were created in Rift Valley following independence.
     Non-Kalenjins living in these settlement schemes are regarded as foreigners or
     bunot. As explained by a member of the Kalenjin Council of Elders:
             According to the Kalenjin culture, visitors are received in a special way. In the language
             of the Kalenjin we call those people Bunot. Bunot is not a derogatory name; it is a
             name that describes that you do not come from that area. There is a process that the
             Kalenjin people carry out to assimilate those people into a cohesive life. […] So, the
             Kalenjin Community requires nothing but recognition by those who came that they are
             Bunot and the others are the indigenous people. To bring about healing, the Kalenjin
             Community would like to ask the other communities and particularly the Kikuyu
             Community because they are predominant, they are our neighbours, they own land and
             we have intermarried, to recognize that they are Bunot.21

36.	     Although it was claimed, as quoted above, that the term ‘bunot’ is not derogatory,
         non-Kalenjins in the region perceive this characterization both as derogatory
         and the source of ethnic tension and the violence and eviction that they have
         experienced in the past. According to a witness:
             The word “bunot” was explained in detail here as a stranger or a person who has stayed
             in a place for a while. […] So, the word “bunot” shows that we Kikuyus are still tagged as
             strangers and we have never been accepted as residents of this place.22

37.	     And as described by another witness:
             When you stay there for long with people from a certain community, you speak their
             language fluently, just like them, but the people there, though you have lived with
             them, know that you are not one of them. They just know you as a foreigner.23

38.	     In addition to being referred to as bunot, non-Kalenjin communities who have
         settled in Rift Valley are generally referred to as madoadoa.24 In areas predominantly
         occupied by Maasai, such as Narok and Kajiado, the Kikuyus in particular are referred
         to as thabai. According to a witness, who was brutally attacked and forcefully evicted
         from his farm in Narok during the 2007 PEV:
             They [the Maasai] used to refer to us as spots and thabai, which is a thorny plant. Thabai
             is a Kikuyu name for that plant.

             Of names and their meaning
             39.	 In Coast and Rift Valley alike, a thorny issue that is intricately tied to the
                  notion of insiders and outsiders relates to names of places. In particular,
                  local communities in these two regions are aggrieved that places occupied
                  by those they consider outsiders have been given ‘outside names’. In Lamu,
                  a witness lamented before the Commission that a lake that was previously
                  called Mkunguya had its names changed to Kenyatta:
                           There is a lake there [Mpeketoni] called Lake Kenyatta. How did it get to be called Lake
                           Kenyatta in this area? How did the name Kenyatta find its way in this area? If we go
                           back into our history and our culture, the lake was called the Mkunguya Lake. But now
                           it has become Lake Kenyatta. There are names that have been brought in from central
                           […] Why is there this plot to even change the names of places that hold our history
                           and our origin in this place?25

12           REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION
                                                                                                                     Vol u m e III    Chapter ONE




40.	     The Commission heard a similar issue in Eldoret:

              Finally, names have a meaning. When the Kalenjin Community came back to Uasin
              Gishu, they knew the names of particular areas. However, we have problems with
              names. When our brothers from Central or when the children of Mumbi came to Uasin
              Gishu, they came with their names. From the Kalenjin perspective, the soil is alive. The
              soil has its spirit. That is where languages clash. The soil is alive and it knows its owners
              and its name. However, when somebody else brings a name, there is a clash. The soil
              says, “What is this name? What is your totem? What is your clan?” I do not blame the
              Kikuyu Community. However, we would like to tell them that the names they have
              given the lands they have occupied continue to create conflict in the spiritual realm.
              For that reason, conflict demonstrates itself practically.26

41.	     During electoral processes, the foregoing issues are often used to ignite violence
         against ‘outsiders’ who are required to vote for ostensibly the preferred political
         candidate of the local community. Writing in the Oxford Transitional Justice
         Research Working Paper Series, Dr. Lukoye Atwoli captured this notion succintly:

              A recurring theme in many marketplace and bar-room debates is the need for ‘foreigners’
              who have settled in other people’s ‘territory’ to learn to respect the ‘indigenous’ people.
              In this view, the ‘foreigners’ must not compete for political power with the ‘locals’, and
              whenever a national issue requires a vote, they must vote with the ‘host’ community or
              face dire consequences.27


42.	     Thus in Rift Valley, for example, non-Kalenjins are generally expected to vote
         according to the preferred political candidate amongst the Kalenjin. A member
         of the Kalenjin Council of Elders testified as much before the Commission:

              There is a process that the Kalenjin people carry out to assimilate those people
              into a cohesive life. In Uasin Gishu County, when the Kikuyu Community or other
              communities came to settle and live alongside the Kalenjin Community, that kind of
              process never took place. This, therefore, has left these people living parallel lives all
              along. They have worked together in business, intermarried and live side by side, but
              that spirit that brings people together was never developed. This is the root cause of
              conflict in this region. This is why during elections there is a weak spot in this delicate
              relationship. It is primarily because the people from outside this region vote contrary to
              the voting pattern of the people within the area. So, our people take it that these are not
              our people and we cannot live with them.28

                       Beyond ethnic divides: Stories of heroic roles during the
                                 2007/2008 Post-Election Violence
                     The Commission also received many testimonies illustrating the often heroic role of some
                Kenyans who risked their lives to help members of other communities. As one illustrative
                example, the Commission was told of a Kalenjin who hid two Kikuyu families in his house during
                the 2007-2008 post-election violence. In another instance, a blind Kikuyu man was rescued by a
                young Kalenjin while fleeing the violence in Naivasha in 2008:
                     We met one Kalenjin who was a young man that I had known before who was an ex-chief.
                He 	 agreed to hold my hand. He said that there were warriors within the bushes and that if
                they saw him holding my hand they would probably kill him as well. So we went through the
                bushes [TJRC/Hansard/Public Hearing/Naivasha/26 September 2011]
                     Another witness told the Commission how the Chief of Lumumba, who is a Nandi, saved the
                Kikuyu in his community in 2008:
                     He is called Samatei. He helped the people of Kamukunji. Nobody was killed. He is a man
                who loves God and people. He should be thanked. The other chiefs went against him. He
                transferred the APs [administrative police officers] who were Nandi. He said that he did not want
                them [TJRC/Hansard/In-Camera Hearing/Naivasha/27 September 2011]
                     Another witness was saved by his neighbour during the 2007-2008 post-election violence
                in Naivasha:
                     	 Now it was approaching 12:00 pm and attacks had started at 9:00 am. My neighbour,
                a Kikuyu woman, came to the window and told my wife: ‘Let me escort you because women
                are not being attacked. Can I escort you with the children to the police station?’ […] [My wife]
                requested her to tell the police where we were. The lady came to our house and informed us that
                the police were outside. So we were rescued by the police [TJRC/Hansard/In-Camera Hearing/
                Naivasha/27 September 2011]
                     The Commission wishes to recognize these brave Kenyans and hopes that their examples
                will be used to foster reconciliation.



             State sanctions of outside/insider notions
             43.	    The designation of a community as ‘other’ or as an outsider has sometimes found
                     support in state policy. In the northern region of the country, particularly in those
                     areas that made up the former North Eastern Province, the Government has
                     institutionalised the disparate treatment of Kenyans based on ethnicity by requiring
                     that Kenyans of Somali origin carry a special pass. While the Government claimed
                     that requiring such passes assisted in distinguishing between Kenyans of Somali
                     origin who are legally present in the region and non-Kenyans of Somali origin, often
                     from Somalia, who may not be legally present, the local Kenyans attribute more
                     sinister motives.

             44.	    This theme is addressed in detail in this Report in Chapter Three of Volume 2C
                     which documents the experiences of ethnic minorities and indigenous people.

Negative perceptions and stereotypes
44.	     Negative perceptions and stereotypes are a major cause of ethnic tension in the
         country. Labels have been put on certain communities, portraying them in broad,
         often negative terms that generalise certain traits and apply them to all individuals
         belonging to the described community, regardless of how individuals perceive
         themselves. For example, the Kikuyu are sometimes described as thieves, the Maasai
         as primitive, the Somali as terrorists, etc. The testimony of Commissioner Halakhe
         Wago of the National Cohesion and Integration Commission (NCIC) before the
         Commission during its thematic hearing on ethnic tension and violence is instructive
         in this regard:
             There are negative attitudes towards individuals and social groups. For example, for so
             long there has been a kind of perception about the pastoralists like the Maasai as always
             being primitive. The same pastoralists, courtesy of the Somalis and their likes in the north,
             are seen as being warlike. The Kikuyu are thieves because a few people have picked things
             here and there or love money because they have been industrious or worked hard. The
             Luhya and the Kamba are at times referred to as liars and at times as very loyal. The Luos
             think so much about themselves when there is nothing much about them. We hear so
             many things about all these communities. The Coastals are deemed lazy people. So,
             this has really gone into the minds of many Kenyans to the extent that when they see
             me or you, they will definitely know where to place you as long as your name is clearly
             understood.29

45.	 Wambugu Ngunjiri echoed Halake’s sentiments and further pointed out that
     ethnic steretypes have persisted because of the absence of efforts to debunk such
     stereotypes:
             It is a problem of perceptions, myths and stereotypes about each other. However, nobody
             has tried to debunk this and so we have people growing in various communities who have
             been told that other communities behave in a certain way without taking time to find
             out if it is true. So, we heard conversations that Kikuyus were thieves because a number
             of members of government were involved in theft. For example, in Teso, even the small
             Kikuyu population is perceived as thieves even though there were no direct incidents of
             any of them stealing anything we have reached a point in this country where a lot of our
             conversations are not based on facts, but perceptions that have developed over years.30

46.	     Most of the negative perceptions and stereotypes that are present today in Kenya
         were initially propagated by the colonial government. Besides employing the ‘divide
         and rule’ tactic, the colonialist government also perpetuated ethnic stereotyping.
         Ethnic stereotyping during the colonial period was a silent culture and is therefore
         not well documented. The writings of Kenyans who lived during this period, as well
         as the oral testimony of survivors, gave a general sense of the nature and extent of

                     the stereotyping. Generally, the colonialists praised groups out of which they were
                     able to elicit collaborators, such as the Maasai, but denigrated those ethnic groups
                     out of which many ‘dissidents’ came, such as the Kikuyu.31 JM Kariuki, while giving
                     an account of his experiences at the Kowop camp in Samburu District, paints a
                     picture of ethnic stereotyping during the colonial days:
                           The Turkana said that they had been told by the District Commissioner that we Kikuyu
                           were very disgusting people whose custom it was to eat the breasts of our women and
                           even the embryos of children in the womb. Any Turkana or Samburu who brought him
                           the head of an escaped detainee would be rewarded with posho (food), sugar and tea.32

             47.	    The colonial government succeeded in creating a picture of the Kikuyu as barbaric
                     and savage who should thus not be allowed to interact feely with others in
                     society. In creating negative stereotypes of the Kikuyu and others, the colonial
                     government furthered a policy of economic, social and political marginalisation of
                     other communities.

             48.	 The colonial government’s response to the Mau Mau rebellion included
                  perpetuating stereotypes and dividing Kenyans based upon ethnicity. For
                  example, the colonial government hired large numbers of Luo to work on white
                  farms to replace the ‘untrustworthy’ Kikuyu and included disproportionally
                  large numbers of the Kamba community in the army. The country was thus
                  easily balkanised in the early 1960s when the colonial government declared its
                  intention to grant Kenya independence.

             Culture and stereotypes
             49.	    While the colonial government played an important role in cultivating ethnic
                     stereotypes, the Commission also received evidence that some stereotypes are
                     drawn from and driven by traditional cultural beliefs and practices. For instance,
                     the Commission heard that men from communities that do not practice male
                     circumcision have always been stigmatised and regarded as lesser or weaker men,
                     and therefore, incapable of or unsuitable to take political leadership of the country.
                     As one witness testified:
                           When it comes to issues of leadership, you will not be shocked to find that people who
                           are supposed to be national leaders, saying that the Luo cannot ascend to offices of
                           leadership because they are not circumcised. In the run-up to the 2007 elections, one
                           much respected leader [...] did say publicly that Hon. Raila Odinga cannot be President
                           of this country because he is not circumcised.33

                                                                                         Vol u m e III   Chapter ONE




50.	     Not only has this particular stereotype been used on the political arena to discredit
         politicians from communities that do not practice male circumcision, but it has
         also fuelled targeted and barbaric forms of violence against members of such
         communities. Such violence was meted out particularly against members of the Luo
         community during the 2007/2008 PEV. The Commission of Inquiry into the Post-
         Election Violence (CIPEV) recorded forceful circumcision and penile amputation
         of members of the Luo community, reportedly perpetrated by members of the
         Mungiki, particularly in Naivasha, Nairobi and Nakuru.34 The Commission received
         similar evidence during its hearings in Kisumu.

51.	     Ethnic stereotyping has been extremely damaging to ethnic relations in Kenya.
         Indeed, some ethnic groups partly attribute their historical economic marginalization
         to stereotypes that have all along been perpetuated about them. The nexus between
         ethnic stereotyping and economic marginalization was well drawn by a witness in
         Kisumu:
             Our people [the Luo], because of persistent and consistent exposure to negativity,
             have come out to be stigmatized, isolated, uprooted and made hopeless. As a result
             of this, all the negative adjectives have been used to describe them, and which
             unfortunately, they have come to believe and even talk about. Among them is that
             they are lazy. This is diametrically opposed to their virtue of hard work. Two, they
             are lovers of good life, and thirdly, they are unenterprising. Fourthly, they are too
             cultural or too traditional. Fifth, they are immoral, proud, antagonistic, empty hero
             worshippers, backwards and wallowers in political adversity. They are too communal.
             All these have been summarized that a Luo should not even have a place in this
             society. They cannot even occupy leadership positions. Psychologically, this is what
             the people have believed and they live with it. Commissioners, this is closely related
             to the question of economic emasculation. If you have taken the mind and soul of a
             person, what remains is a hopeless shell.35

52.	     A perception study conducted by the Institute of Economic Affairs in 2009 found
         that respondents had more positive than negative opinions of ethnic groups other
         than their own. The study also found that many of the negative comments by the
         respondents on their opinion of other ethnic groups were based on traditional
         stereotypes about the particular ethnic groups. The study also revealed that 79.1%
         of the respondents would marry a person from another ethnic group while 86% of
         them would be a business partner to person of another ethnicity. In essence, the
         study revealed that members of different ethnic groups do not necessarily have
         inherent hatred for each other. Rather, they are willing to and often co-exist together.
         The results of the study are shown in the Tables below.

             Ethnic tension amongst pastoralist communities
             53.	      Ethnic tension and violence in specific parts of the country is influenced by the
                       dynamics of cattle rustling and other resource-based conflicts. While electioneering
                       and insider/outsider dynamics are factors that help to explain ethnic tension and
                       violence among pastoralist communities, resource-based conflicts are equally
                       important. This is not surprising as access to important resources such as grazing
                       land and water has diminished over time with the increase in the pastoralist
                       population and the encroachment into pastoralist areas by sedentary communities.

             54.	      Reuben Kendagor testified before the Commission about cattle rustling between
                       the Tugen Community of Baringo North and the Pokot. His testimony highlights
                       the long history of such clashes, the intersection of ethnicity and resource-based
                       conflicts, the escalation of violence with the introduction of high powered weapons,
                       and the inability or unwillingness of the Government to provide security to these
                       communities:

             [W]e are a community that has been offended for a long time. History tells us that the
             first offence was committed in 1918 when our community was invited for a meeting in
             a place called Chepkesin in Ng’orora. During this incident, the meeting was expected to
             be a peace meeting but we are told that everyone in the meeting had a weapon. Our
             men were told to untie their bows. This is what happened and our people were massively
             killed. Down the line in 1977 to 1979, our neighbour community invaded our land causing
             a number of injuries and a large number of livestock were taken away. Most of us moved
             away. Up to date, I can tell you most of our people are living as far away as Nakuru, Eldoret,
             Trans Nzoia and so on because of the harsh raids by our neighbour. After 1987, the same
             problem emerged. That is when the sophisticated weapons were used. The AK47 was
             used and we began losing lives. This was serious because people were killed even on
             the wayside. People moved massively. It became more serious when we lost one of our
             great athletes, a standard six boy, in 2006 in a place called Sitegi in Kaptura Sub-Location,
             Ng’orora Location. This time round, it made so many families to leave their homes and so
             many children leave school. During the post-election violence of 2007, this became very
             serious. We identified one of the raids as a massacre because in a village called Kamwotyo
             we lost seven people at one time. A lot of animals were taken away. There were gunshots
             all over. Our people moved towards Kerio Valley. Today, we have people who are settled
             along River Kerio as IDPs. […] We lament because ours is a community that will never
             counter-attack anybody at all. This community has been very bitter. Most of our people
             call upon the Government to come to their rescue when these incidents happen to them.
             Unfortunately, the Government has never shown any commitment let alone disarming
             our dangerous neighbours.36

55.	     The Pokot have had similar encounters with the Turkana. The Commission was
         informed that since the 1960s, the Pokot and Turkana communities have engaged
         in endless wars over cattle, pasture and water.37 Pastoralist communities in the north
         and north eastern regions of the country also have a long history of ethnically-
         based resource conflicts, including cattle rustling.38 The practice, however, has
         become more dangerous due to proliferation of firearms and ammunition into the
         region from neighbouring Ethiopia and Somalia, leading to banditry and general
         insecurity.39

56.	     According to the Akiwumi Report, the ethnic tension and violence in Northern
         Kenya involve “fighting between Somali clans and between Somali clans and the
         Borana tribe and their cousins such as the Orma, the Burji and the Garre.”40 In
         recent years, such clashes involved Borana and Degodia in Isiolo; Degodia and
         Ajuran in Wajir; Garre and Degodia in Wajir and Mandera; Borana and Degodia in
         Moyale; Degodia and Orma in Tana River; Ogaden and Munyoyaya, Pokomo and
         Malokote in Tana River; and Galjael, Orma and Sanye.41

Volume III   Chapter ONE




             57.	     Ethnic tension and violence among pastoralist communities are often caused by a
                      number of factors, including:

                       	   Frequent droughts and resultant inadequacy of water and grass. These recurrent
                            droughts cause the drying up of dams, pans, springs and rivers leaving only a few
                            that endure the severity of such vagaries of weather. Depending on the location
                            of the water point or grazing areas, the indigenous communities more often than
                            not, give very difficult conditions, which include cash payments or payments in
                            form of animals for water or grass. This often generates into violent hostilities
                            which can only be dealt with by the survival of the fittest, leading to skirmishes.

                       	   Cattle rustling is one of the major causes of ethnic and clan animosity and
                            violence as the victimized group engages in revenge missions which not only
                            lead to theft of large herds of cattle and other livestock but to loss of human
                            life and multiple injuries to many people.

                       	   The proliferation of firearms from Somalia and Ethiopia has enabled tribes and
                            clans in the region to establish formidable clandestine militia which increases
                            the willingness to use violence to advance interests or solve disputes.

                       	   Diminished access to important resources such as water and grazing land has
                            led ethnic groups to increase their efforts to control resource rich territories,
                            and has also led to election-related violence as ethnic groups and clans
                            compete to increase areas controlled by members of their community.42

             58.	     The political dimension of ethnic tension in the northern region, and the complicated
                      relationship among the factors contributing to such tensions and violence, was
                      touched on by Commissioner Waqo of the NCIC in his testimony before the
                      Commission:
                           Sometimes you cannot differentiate between peace, natural resource based and political
                           interest based conflicts. For example, what is happening in Moyale today is not so easy for
                           anybody to differentiate. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian
                           Affairs (OCHA) Report showed that it was based on water and pasture problems, whereas
                           many others stood up and said that there is nothing to do with pasture and water. After all,
                           they have received the highest rainfall in the last ten years in that region. So, it is not very
                           easy to tell the differences in some of the instances, but we need a lot of reinforcement
                           of security because of illicit arms. In most of the situations, without any provocation or

Ethnicity and politics
59.	      The first President of independent Kenya, Jomo Kenyatta, did little to counter the
          ethnic divisions created by the colonial government. During his tenure a small
          elite group popularly referred to as the “Kiambu Mafia” dominated Kenyan politics,
          resulting in the emergence of a class of capitalists who were mainly members of
          the Kikuyu community.44 This class enjoyed huge economic prosperity and political
          influence and repressed any resistance against it. As a result, other ethnic groups
          as well as many non-conforming Kikuyus were alienated from government affairs.45

60.	      President Kenyatta’s authoritarian style of leadership soon began to attract staunch
          opposition from some of his previous allies including the then Vice-President,
          Jaramogi Oginga Odinga, who later broke with KANU to form the Kenya Peoples’
          Union (KPU). Although its main aim was to counter KANU’s ethno-politics, it is rather
          ironic that Odinga’s KPU was far from a model of ethnic diversity as it found support
          almost exclusively from people of Luo ethnicity.46 The formation of KPU therefore
          enhanced, rather than reduced, the balkanization of the country along ethnic lines.
          In 1969, following the Kisumu Massacre, KPU was banned. A few months before KPU
          was banned, Tom Mboya had been assassinated. The assassination of Tom Mboya
          and subsequent banning of KPU posisoned ethnic relations in the country, especially
          the relationship between the Kikuyu and the Luo. It was believed that the state,
          headed by President Kenyatta, had assassinated Tom Mboya. This believe solidly
          united the Luo against the Kikuyu and vise versa.47 The Kikuyu on their part began
          an oathing campaign to ensure that all Kikuyu’s owed allegiance to the President in
          particular and the ‘House of Mumbi’.48 The Commission received evidence about the
          occurrence of the oathing ceremonies and the impact that these ceremonies had on
          ethnic relations:
               I was removed from class in 1969. I was in Standard Four. There was tension but I could not
               understand whether it was in the whole country. Afterwards, I understood that it affected
               Central Province. We were taken through the rituals of the Kikuyu. It was called “oathing”.
               So, I have grown up knowing that Kenya is just for one tribe. I remember that I was in
               Standard Four. I could not understand, as the women of Central Province, why we were
               being told that we should not get married to men from other tribes, and especially the
               Luo community. In that ritual, my agemates did not want to speak about that particular
               issue. That is what caused confusion among us. We lived in a dilemma as we grew up and
               brought up our children. We were not free to speak to our children about the source of our
               differences with other people.49

             61.	    Another witness told the Commission the following story that confirms that
                     oathing ceremonies did take place:
                           The oathing was done to maintain the presidency in the House of Mumbi. There
                           were people denying it in Provincial Administration. But I want to tell you one thing:
                           The Provincial Administration then was operating outside the law. It was guided by
                           different rules. So, there were calls in the newspapers that oathing was going on and
                           my Provincial Commissioner then, Mr. Koinange, denied that there were such activities
                           going on. As innocent as I was, I thought it was true that the PC did not know. So, there
                           was an inspector of police, an OCS who was working with me when I was a DC. I called
                           him and said: “Do you think this oathing is going on because we can see people being
                           transported in buses? Is it true?” Then he told me: “I tell you, the Government is behind
                           it.” I told him: “No, you cannot be serious because the PC told me it was not true.” I
                           believed PC, DC or DO was speaking on behalf of the Government. So, I said: “This is
                           not true.” So, he told me: “If you want to prove let us go to your chief’s office tonight.” I
                           had a chief in Kiini Location in Kirinyaga District. I think that location is still there, but
                           it has, probably been sub-divided. So, we took off with him and a few askaris and we
                           found the oathing going on. When we found the oathing going on, we arrested one
                           person and the chief ran away. So, I took the paraphernalia that was being used. When
                           I came back to my house, I told my wife that I think the PC is going to like me because
                           he was saying there was no oathing, but I have got this paraphernalia that they were
                           using to administer it. My first car was a Volkswagen 1200. So, I just drove to Nyeri and
                           went and told the PC that, “you were saying there is no oathing, but, probably, you do
                           not know; it is going on. I have some things to prove to you that it is going on”. Then I
                           went and brought the things to his office. He told me: “Who told you to take the law in
                           your hands and go to that place? Did I order you to do so?” I said: “No, Sir.” He told me:
                           “Go back.” The same day, I was transferred from Kirinyaga to Murang’a. Before I reached,
                           Mr. Koinange was there with his Mercedes Benz and askaris. He said: “Pack up and go.”
                           So, I was startled a little bit. That was when I learnt that in order for you to succeed in the
                           provincial administration, there are only a few words that you should say: “Yes, sir, no sir,
                           thank you, sir.” That probably continues up to date. I do not know because I have been
                           out of it for a long time.

             62.	    The effects of these ceremonies continue to be felt today and electoral competitions
                     in Kenya, have always had ethnic undertones.

             63.	    In the period during which KANU enjoyed a political monopoly, ethnicity and
                     sycophancy took a central place in the country’s politics. When the President’s
                     health begun to fail in the 1970s, his close allies and staunch supporters, mainly
                     from the Kikuyu community, begun to look for ways of installing a “friendly”
                     president other than President Kenyatta’s then Vice-President, Daniel arap Moi, a
                     Kalenjin. The main fear of President Kenyatta’s allies was that the presidency would
                     go to someone from another ethnic group, thus depriving them of the trappings

         of power. Although the effort to sideline Moi was unsuccessful, it underscored
         the continued ethnicization of Kenyan politics, and the perception that ethnic
         representation at the highest levels of government would translate into widespread
         benefits for members of that community.

64.	     Daniel arap Moi entered the presidency with the pledge that he would move the
         country away from the curse and blemish of ethno-politics.50 The early years of his
         presidency showed promise, with his government initially including Kenyans from
         a wide variety of ethnic communities. Moi’s first cabinet, for example, included 11
         ethnic groups: eight Kikuyu, three Kalenjin, three Luhya, three Luo, two Kisii, and one
         Maasai, Taita, Kamba, Embu, Digo and Meru.51

65.	 President Moi quickly became preoccupied with suppressing his perceived
     opponents. This preoccupation with limiting dissent and consolidating power
     accelerated after the attempted coup in 1982. Campaigns to address corruption,
     ethnicity and human rights abuses fell aside as President Moi and his government
     centralized power and tackled dissent.52 To consolidate his political power President
     Moi filled the civil service and state-owned institutions with members of his ethnic
     group and those from ethnic communities that were viewed as supportive of the
     regime.53

66.	     There is evidence that President Moi’s administration took a page from the
         colonial government and used divide and rule tactics to pit ethnic communities
         against each other.54 This policy became particularly evident after the re-
         introduction of multi-party politics in the country in the early 1990s. The
         introduction of multiparty politics and elections coincided with a wave of ethnic
         violence in parts of the country. The NCIC summarizes Moi’s tenure as president
         in the following terms:
              Despite the Nyayo philosophy of peace, love and unity, there was insufficient attention
              to past grievances among Kenyans in the 1980s through to the 1990s. Specifically, there
              was: (i) lack of decisive land reforms, and land-based conflicts persisted; (ii) little regard
              to Kenya’s diversity in employing or appointing public sector employees; (iii) inequitable
              distribution of budgetary resources; (iv) mismanagement of public resources; and (v)
              autocratic governance; among other challenges55

             67.	    The re-introduction of multi-party politics in the early 1990s, and the demise
                     of KANU’s authoritarian rule in 2002 renewed hopes of national healing and
                     reconciliation among the various ethnic communities in the country. There was
                     earnest expectation that the government would create an enabling environment
                     that would ensure equality and non-discrimination for its citizens. Contrary to this
                     popular expectation, most of the 1990s were a continuation of the un-democratic
                     practices birthed at independence. In fact, the re-introduction of multi-party politics
                     in 1991 only increased ethnic identities and divisions as the country’s political parties
                     were mainly regional, ethnic-based and poorly institutionalised. The nature and
                     composition of the political parties founded in 1992 and thereafter attest to this fact
                     in that even the self-styled national parties have ethnic or regional undercurrents.

             68.	    It may be argued that Kenya’s third multi-party elections, held in December 2002,
                     presented the best opportunity for the development of an ethnically integrated
                     country. This was primarily because of the creation of the National Rainbow
                     Coalition (NARC), and interethnic political party. This opportunity was nonetheless
                     lost as NARC’s promise to end ethnicity was not translated into actual policies and
                     programs. In fact President Kibaki’s administration has been viewed as no better
                     than its predecessors in relation to instilling a sense of national identity stronger
                     than a sense of ethnic identity.

Land
69.	      Land is a key factor in understanding ethnic tension and violence in Kenya. When
          the white settlers came to Kenya, they found some parts of the country unsuitable
          for their settlement, “either because of the climate or because it was infested by
          tsetse fly.”56 However, the land between the Gikuyu escarpment and Lake Victoria
          was deemed potentially rich for agro-based development. Owing to its favourable
          climate and fertile soils and given that the Uganda Railway traversed the region,
          white settlers were determined to turn it into a “white man’s country”.57 Thus, from
          the early-1900s, there was an influx of settlers from Britain and South Africa.58 At the
          same time the colonial government began to impose restrictions access to land by
          the existing Kenyan residents. The NCIC recently summarized this restrictive and
          discriminatory history:
              During the colonial era, there was extensive land expropriation and resettlement by
              the colonialists from the indigenous communities. Land expropriation was extensive,
              from 2 million hectares in 1914 to 3 million hectares on the eve of independence.
              The expropriation was achieved through various laws, ordinances and promulgations,
              including the Native Trust Bill of 1926 which restricted indigenous groups to the Native
              Reserves. These realities raised the profile of land ownership and required extensive
              attention into independence to reduce their adverse impact on national cohesion and
              integration in Kenya. Land-related issues continue to be a lingering source of conflict
              to date.59

70.	      The European invasion of the White Highlands, as the region later came to be
          known, became the source of economic marginalization in the country. In the
          main, European occupation of the region meant displacement of Africans from
          their traditional homeland.60

71.	      Kenyans displaced from their land by the colonial government were concentrated
          in reserves, something that considerably restricted their socio-economic life.61
          Those who did not prefer to live in the reserves remained in European farms either
          as squatters or as labourers, or sought employment in urban areas.62

72.	      The Mau Mau rebellion to colonial rule had a profound impact on the country since
          it forced the colonial government to rethink and reformulate its discriminatory

                      policies.63 Politically, it provoked socio-economic and constitutional reforms
                      “designed to alleviate the grievances of those Africans who had not yet chosen to
                      resort to violence, and to stem support for those who had.”64 While these policies
                      were aimed at minimizing rebellion and dissent, they further divided Kenyans
                      along ethnic lines.

             73.	     Central to many of the ethnic tensions in post-independence Kenya is the issue of
                      redistribution of the land formerly occupied by white settlers.65 Due to the skewed
                      post-colonial land redistribution policy that was deliberately designed to favour
                      the ruling class and not the landless masses, it is now estimated that more than half
                      of the arable land in the country is in the hands of only 20% of the population.66
                      Politicians in successive governments used land to induce patronage and build
                      political alliances.67 Much of the most valuable and productive land has ended up
                      in the hands of the political class, members of their families, and friends (often of
                      the same ethnicity) rather than being returned to the communities from which the
                      colonialists had taken it.68

74.	      The practice of illegal allocation and distribution of land has led to a general
          feeling of marginalisation among some communities as well as the ethnicization of
          the land question. The Commission of Inquiry into the Illegal/Irregular Allocation
          of Pubic Land (the Ndung’u Commission) noted that throughout the 1980s and
          1990s public land was illegally and irregularly allocated “in total disregard of the
          public interest and in circumstances that fly in the face of the law.”69 This became
          the foundation of ethnic tensions, and later violence, particularly in the Rift Valley
          and Coast Provinces.

          potential areas that have ample rainfall and fertile lands, the government has
          encouraged asymmetrical development in the country that, because of the ethnic
          dimension of land allocation and ownership, itself has ethnic consequences.70 The
          relationship among land ownership, development, and ethnicity is summarized
          in a recent report by the NCIC:
              The Sessional Paper No. 10 of 1965 on African Socialism and its Application to
              Development and Planning sought to empower Kenyan citizens of the new nation
              through the provision of services and expansion of economic opportunities. In
              doing so, the Government adopted the Africanization Policy to replace the departing
              European and Asian communities with educated or skilled Africans. Most jobs, firms
              and businesses were taken over by the African elite but in an ethnically biased manner
              that also led to the exclusion of Kenyan Asians and Europeans from citizenship and
              appointments in the civil service. In addition, Sessional Paper No. 10 dismissed the
              livestock-based pastoralist economy and in the process contributed to unequal
              development patterns and the marginalization of non-crop-farming communities.
              There are historical legislative frameworks and policies that facilitate undesirable
              ethnic and race divisions. Examples of these frameworks and policies are: the Stock
              and Produce Theft Act which came into operation on 5th May 1933 and is still in force;
              Sessional Paper No 10 of 1965 that highlighted the areas with potential for growth
              and relegated other areas to underdevelopment without regard to the people who
              live there; and The Indemnity Act of 1970 which gives immunity to perpetrators of
              state violence against its citizens in Northern Kenya. Legislative frameworks that
              would have enhanced harmonious ethnic and racial coexistence were largely ignored
              or subverted. In addition, poor and lopsided economic policies and planning have
              enhanced inequality and ethnic tensions.71

             76.	     Regional inequalities and imbalance in the country are still evident today (for
                      a discussion of the impact of Sessional Paper No. 10 of 1965, see chapter on
                      Marginalisation). The discrepancies between the various regions of the country
                      are wide, while about 45 percent of the country’s modern sector employment72 is
                      concentrated in less than 15 towns.73 Thus, the resultant disconnection between the
                      various ethnic communities and regions of the country perpetuated by the colonial
                      administration provided the ethno-regionalised basis for political and economic
                      discrimination of some citizens in post-colonial Kenya. Explaining this phenomenon
                      within the context of the ethnic tensions and violence in the Rift Valley and Central
                      provinces, the KNCHR noted:
                           The colonial government alienated most of the agriculturally productive land for settler
                           agriculture particularly in Rift Valley and Central. This alienation generated a large number
                           of squatters especially among the Kikuyu. At independence, the Kenyatta government
                           created a land market of ‘willing seller willing buyer’ with many of the landless being
                           encouraged to join land-buying companies. Rift Valley Province was earmarked for
                           settlement of the landless through this scheme. However, land did not necessarily revert
                           to those who had lost it through colonialism. […] Over the years, as the population of
                           the Kalenjin who view Rift Valley as their ‘ancestral home’ increased, the perception also
                           grew that the post-colonial land policies had disadvantaged the community. These
                           grievances featured prominently in the 1990s violence as well as the 2002 elections that
                           saw the election of President Mwai Kibaki and the National Rainbow Coalition (NARC)
                           government.74

             77.	     Historical injustices related to land is thus one of the major causes of ethnic
                      tensions and violence in the country. The Ministry of Justice, National Cohesion
                      and Constitutional Affairs underscores this point:
                           Although there was need for massive land redistribution [at independence], this was not
                           implemented effectively and equitably. Land redistribution initiatives were generally
                           mismanaged and resulted in unequal access to land. The mismanagement heightened
                           conflict between various societal groups, given the importance of land as a source of
                           wealth.75

             78.	     Instead of redistributing land to those communities who had been displaced at
                      independence, the government adopted a “willing buyer willing seller” program.
                      Professor Walter Oyugi testified before the Commission about how the willing-
                      buyer-willing-seller redistribution policy was abused, leading to ethnic tensions in
                      the country:

28           REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION
                                                                                               Vol u m e III   Chapter ONE




              This policy of willing-buyer, willing-seller would benefit mainly people who could
              access financial resources. Somebody advised the people from Central Province that
              the best thing to do is to form land buying companies. The land buying companies
              were formed. They included the Ngwataniro, Nyakinyua and Mabati group. The
              Mabati Group meant a group of women helping one another to roof their houses
              and so on, but they also became land buying groups. They were assisted by the
              state and, therefore, the feeling of preferential access and the resentment that
              accompanied that. It continued under the leadership of the then Minister for Lands
              and Settlement, throughout the 1960s into the 1970s. But there would be a change
              in late 1970s, after Mzee died and Moi came into power. He inherited the Kenyatta
              infrastructure of governance and promised that he would follow his footsteps. He
              did by and large, but on the issue of land, which actually took place under his watch
              as the Vice-President, soon after he came into power, he completely disorganized
              the land buying companies and disbanded them, but I thought that it was too late
              at that time.76

79.	     Land, particularly access to rich and productive land, was also a factor in ethnic
         violence in the Rift Valley during elections. Some scholars have noted:
              In 1991, much of the violence was centred around farms which were formerly part
              of the so-called ‘white highlands’, land appropriated from those communities who
              customarily owned and occupied it by the colonial government for white settler
              farming. Mitetei farm in Tinderet Division, Nandi District, provides an example:
              purchased by members of the Kikuyu, Kamba, Luhya, Luo and Kisii communities, it
              is located in traditionally Kalenjin land. Some local Kalenjin argued that they should
              also receive shares in the farm, leading to a dispute in which the local authorities took
              the side of the Kalenjin, because of ethnic affiliations and party politics. This farm was
              the scene of attacks by Kalenjin on the 29th October, 1991, causing all non-Kalenjin
              occupiers to flee. In or about June, 1992, the farm was surveyed and shared among
              local Kalenjin people, and titles were issued to them to the exclusion of those who
              had been forcibly displaced. Those who took over the property refused to reimburse
              the IDPs for the cost of their shares, arguing that it was ‘rent’ for land which really
              belonged to Kalenjin. Owiro farm in Songhor location, Tinderet Division, is another
              property bought from a European by non-Kalenjin (Luo) individuals using bridging
              finance from the Agricultural Finance Corporation (AFC). The owners of this farm were
              also killed or forcibly displaced during the 1991 violence.77

80.	     The finer details of the inter-section between grievances over land and ethnic
         relations have been dealt with in greater detail in the chapter on land and
         conflict.

             Ethnicity and access to Public Office
             81.	      The perception that ethnic representation in government results in direct economic
                       and other benefits to the represented community is pervasive in Kenya. While the
                       Commission acquired evidence that such benefits do not necessarily accrue to those
                       communities who are represented - even in the highest offices of the land - the
                       perception that they do leads to intense competition for such representation, and
                       thus increases the likelihood of violence during elections. According to Prof. Walter
                       Oyugi:
                           Ethnicity is an expression of ethnic consciousness in a competitive environment.
                           When people feel that they are being marginalized in the competitive process, their
                           consciousness is heightened. When they think there is exclusion in the structure of access,
                           their consciousness is heightened and mobilization is very easy by the politicians.78

             82.	      Throughout Kenya's post-independence history the ethnicity of the president has
                       influenced the composition of the cabinet. According to a study by KIPPRA "The
                       tenure of first government of independent Kenya reflects the disproportionate
                       presence of the president's ethnic Kikuyu group in the cabinet".79 This pattern
                       was repeated both in President Moi's and President Kibaki's administration as
                       shown in the table below similarly an analysis of ethnic distribution of permanent
                       secretaries show that the Kikuyus were over subscribed as permanent secretaries
                       in the period 1966 to early 1980s.80 From 1978 to 2001 the number of Kalenjin
                       permanent secretaries grew to nearly three times their share of the national
                       population.

          communities – Kikuyu, Kalenjin, Luhya, Kamba and Luo occupy nearly 70 percent
          of civil service employment. Other findings of the study include that the Kikuyu
          constitute the largest single dominant ethnic group in all ministries and departments,
          except in the Prisons Department, the Office of the Prime Minister and the Kenya
          Police and that the Kalenjin are the second largest group in the civil service.81

84.	      Another study by NCIC which focused on the ethnic diversity of public universities in
          Kenya found that these institutions are heavily ethnicised. According to the study:82

                     	    The percentages of employment in the universities and constituent colleges
                           of the Kikuyu, Luhya, Kalenjin, Luo, Kisii, Embu, Kenyan Europeans, Kenyan
                           Asians, Nubi and Taita communities are higher than their national population
                           ratio (as per the 2009 population census).

                     	    Some of the differences such as that of the Embu community are however
                           negligible (0.13 percent) while others such as that of the Kikuyu community is
                           significant .

                     	    The communities whose representation in the universities’ employment
                           is less than their population ratio include the Somali (with the highest
                           underrepresentation, at six percent), the Kamba, Mijikenda, Turkana and Maasai.

                     	    There is a notable lack of some ethnic groups such as the Tharaka, Gabbra,
                           Orma, Burji, Gosha, Dasnach and Njemps, among others.

                     	    In the public universities and constituent colleges, the five largest communities
                           - the Kikuyu, Luhya, Kalenjin, Luo and Kamba who together make up about
                           66% of the Kenyan population constitute over 81 percent of the total
                           workforce. This severs opportunities to enhance the face of Kenya in these
                           institutions thus excluding the other more than 37 ethnic communities. For
                           example, in the six public universities analysed, the representation of the five
                           big communities is over 86 percent.

                     	    most of the staff in the public universities and constituent colleges come from
                           the communities within which the institutions are located

                     	    The spread of universities in Kenya excludes the northern part of the country
                           with most of them located within Nairobi and its environs.

                     	    Kenyans seem to perceive the university as a job creation enterprise for the
                           community within which the university is located. It may be in this perspective
                           that some regions agitate for the establishment of public universities in their
                           areas.



                                The perception that ethnic representation in government
                            results in direct economic and other benefits to the represented
                               community is pervasive in Kenya. While the Commission
                             acquired evidence that such benefits do not necessarily accrue
                            to those communities who are represented - even in the highest
                            offices of the land - the perception that they do leads to intense
                              competition for such representation, and thus increases the
                                          likelihood of violence during election.

             Ethnicity and Displacement
             85.	     The history of displacement in Kenya has been recounded elsewhere in this
                      Report.83 In a nutshell, recent years, especially after the advent of multi-party
                      system of governance, has witnessed repeated waves of ethnic violence in Kenya.
                      However, responses to this recurring problem have not been appropriately and
                      effectively handled by the state. Throughout the 1990s IDPs were rarely assisted
                      by the government. Indeed, the national government was in denial of the issues of
                      IDPs. The absence of political and humanitarian responses have been attributed
                      by human right organisation to a lack of an effective policy, legal or administrative
                      framework to effectively deal with the IDPs crisis.84

             86.	     Various reports by human rights and humanitarians organisations have highlighted
                      not just the plight of IDPs in camps but the lack of a coherent response from the
                      various governmental agencies responsible for IDPs issues. This give an inclination
                      of a serious absence of political will to effectively resolve the issues of displaced
                      people. A report by the KNCHR/FIDH discusses how the National IDPs Network
                      together with KHRC petitioned the office of the President, the Ministry of Justice
                      and the Ministry of Lands which subsequently made the government to respond
                      to their concerns especially from the security, land and governance perspective.85
                      November 2004 President Kibaki set up a Task Force aiming at collecting data on
                      IDPs, registering them and making recommendations for their assistance.86 The
                      registration of IDPs on behalf of the Task Force was meant to be carried out by the
                      DCs and other provincial administrators offices which in actual fact were reluctant
                      to support the process. This did not auger well with the KHRC and the National IDPs
                      Network who deemed the figures and findings from Task Force work inaccurate. By
                      the time the Task Force submitted the report to office of the President in September
                      2006 the KHRC and the National IDPs Network contested the findings with the view
                      that it would mislead the policy formulation process.87 According to KHRC and FIDH
                      this report has not been made public.

             87.	     The violence sparked by the disputed presidential results on 30th December
                      2007 led to a massive displacement, lose of lives and destruction of livelihoods.
                      Report presented by local and international organisation indicated an estimated
                      500,000 persons were internally displaced and parties – Orange Democratic
                      Movement (ODM) led by former Prime Minister Raila Odinga and the Party of

                                                                                                             Vol u m e III   Chapter ONE




         National Unity (PNU) of former President Mwai Kibaki signed the National Accord
         and Reconciliation Agreement (hereafter the National Accord) on 28th February
         2008. This lead to the formation of a Grand Coalition Government (GCG) through
         the sharing of power. One of the commitment in the agreement is the restoration
         of stability and normalcy, including measure to restore fundamental rights and
         liberties, address the humanitarian crisis and promote healing, reconciliation
         and reconstruction.

88.	     One of the key priorities of the National Accord is the resettlement of IDPs
         languishing in camps and other places. Through the Ministry of State for Special
         Progremmes (MoSSP) a resettlement programme dubbed ‘Operartion Rudi
         Nyumbani’ (ORN) was launched on 5th May 2008. However, reports by human
         rights organisation revealed that the resettlement programmes was not working
         because it was not well thought out and its implementation was viewed as
         premature with poor cordination between government ministries, particularly
         with reporting mechanism and accountability.88 A report by KHRC shows there
         was evidence that registration of IDPs was haphazard, incoherent and marred
         with corruption.89 This collaborate a testimony given to the Commission in a
         women’s meeting in Agan Khan Hall Kisumu. A representative of a civil society
         organization told the Commission:
             “There is a strong sentiment regularly expressed by some Government officials that IDPs
             do not exist here. We have heard Government officers constantly under-quoting the
             number of IDPs in this region. In certain places, they give figures as low as 20. When it is
             convenient for them, they are considered to be fake. To date, we have never been given
             a list of IDPs; for example, those who are considered fake and those who are considered
             genuine.90

89.	     The Commission found out that although the government initiated assistance to
         provide kick start or stabalisation cash of Ksh 10,000 and another KES 25,000 to those
         whose houses were burnt, it was outrightly perceived by some as discriminatory.
         This instead of fostering reconciliation, it continued to inflame inter-community
         relations.91 A witness told the Commission is Kisumu,
             “We also need to know who has been rehabilitated. We hear stories of people who are
             getting Kshs3 million but it remains a rumour because where there is no information,
             there is bound to be speculation and that only helps to fuel ethnic animosity that we
             are starting to see.”92

             90.	     The perception of bias and discrimination have also emerged in relation to
                      financial assistance and housing. The Commission found a study by UNDP
                      revealing on the unfortunate situation that faced IDPs that noted with alarm;
                           “Among the returnees to ancestral homes, reconciliation efforts have been compromised
                           by governments’ compensation and resettlement approach. Most of the returnees
                           to the ancestral homes were paid KES 10,000 to restart life. However, other victims of
                           violence who lost property and houses were paid an additional KES 25,000. In Nyanza
                           (Kisumu) where most of the returnees to ancestral homes are currently living, some
                           ‘non-natives’ victims (Kikuyus and Kambas) were paid KES 10,000 and KES 25,000 for loss
                           of property and houses. This has caused a feeling of discrimination against native Luos.
                           There was a feeling among the Luos that the government was discriminating against
                           them and favouring non-Luos particularly, the Kikuyus with regards to compensation.
                           Other government efforts such as the resettlement programme are also perceived to
                           be favouring non-Lous. Reconciliation is further constrained by the fact that the victims
                           who lost their property to neighbours still see their property at their neighbours, yet
                           they find themselves unable to reclaim it. Moreover, reconciliation efforts are rendered
                           elusive owing to the fact that people who were violated continue to wait for justice”.93

             91.	     After displacement cases of discrimination of IDPs was also reported by those
                      who testified before Commission in the public hearing forums. A lady who was
                      in Kachibora IDPs camp around Kitale lamented in pain on how their children
                      were not considered when stipends for bursary were given to children who were
                      enrolling for secondary education after the primary exams. She said,
                           “Our children are suffering a great deal. For instance, this girl you see here passed
                           her KCPE examinations and qualified to go to secondary school, but her life has been
                           reduced to cooking in hotels. This girl was admitted to secondary school, but she is
                           now in Kitale doing nothing. We do not get bursaries. It is like they belong to specific
                           people”. 94

             92.	     These sentiments of discrimination in other relief programmes that were carried
                      out by the government were shared by victims of displacement else where in the
                      country who testified before the Commission in Kisumu.
                           “While other regions are getting fertilizer, seeds, houses, medical aid and regular food
                           supplies, victims in Nyanza, that is, those who were displaced from outside Nyanza and
                           those who come from this area are confined to Kshs10,000 and not everybody got it. The
                           assumption is that the people who came from outside did not own property and were
                           not living any meaningful life but were just labourers and, therefore, all they lost was their
                           wages.” 95

93.	   It appears the state has not had a genuine interest in resettling IDPs and the
       launching of programmes as Operation Rudi Nyumbani (Return Home), Operation
       Ujirani Mwema (Good neighbourliness) and Operation Tujenge Pamoja (Let’s Build
       Together) was primarily motivated by the fact that it only wanted to resettle the
       specific class of IDPs.




Conclusion
Ethnic tension, particularly the tendency to view people who are different as ‘the other’
and thus not identify with, and either fear or scapegoat them, is unfortunately as old as
human history. To understand the continued presence of ethnic tension today, and its
evolution during the mandate period, the Commission traced the roots of ethnic tension
to the colonial period, for it was under the colonial power that the political entity today
known as Kenya was formed. Any discussion of ethnic tension in present-day Kenya
would be incomplete without a discussion of the relationship between ethnicity and
politics. It is an unfortunate fact that who joins a political party, and which politicians or
parties form alliances, can be more often explained by ethnicity over any other factor.
It is this potent, and at times volatile, combination of ethnicity and politics that has
unfortunately spiralled into ethnic violence far too many times in our history. In the end, it
must be appreciated that tackling ethnic tension requires a multifaceted approach aimed
at addressing the root causes, including long standing land grievances and economic and
political marginalisation.

     Ethnic Tension, Land and Politics:
            A Case Study of the Mount
                        Elgon Conflict


Introduction
1.	       Elgon is a 4000 metre high mountain that straddles Kenya and Uganda.
          Between 2006 and 2008, the mountain was wracked by violence that became
          the focus of much of the Commission’s attentions and energies. Estimates
          place the number of people killed in the Mount Elgon conflict at 600.1 The
          victims of sexual violence may run into the hundreds. Up to 45,000 people were
          displaced. The Commission presents the Mount Elgon conflict as a case study
          of a conflict that sits at the intersection of three volatile trends that dominated
          the mandate period. These trends are: ethnic identity and land and electoral
          politics. Individually these trends are disruptive. Collectively, however, they
          carry the potential for deep and sustained crisis with serious implications for
          the protection and violation of human rights. This is then the case study that
          Mount Elgon presents.

             the Mountain
             2.	        Mount Elgon presents a complex ethnic fabric made up of many different ideas
                        and understandings about identity. These form the basis of much recent academic
                        research that the Commission has found useful in its own consideration of
                        ethnicity in Mount Elgon.3 A central identity dominates: the Sabaot. It is from this
                        group that—obviously—the Sabaot Land Defence Force takes its name from. The
                        Sabaot are best understood as a collection made up of four sub-groups known as
                        the Sabiny (or the Sebei in Uganda), the Bongomek, the Kony and the Bok. The
                        name Sabaot has a very specific, recent and traceable history. It emerged in 1949
                        as name that these four groups assigned to themselves as, it has been argued, to
                        the creation of another supra-ethnic group in the region, the Luhya.4 Before that,
                        colonial authorities referred to them simply as ‘Nandi-speakers’. The term ‘Nandi
                        speakers’ was in turn supplanted the term ‘the Kalenjin’ which functioned as
                        another catch-all for a culturally and linguistically connected collective. Each of
                        the Sabaot sub-groups have own readings and understandings of their particular
                        experiences. The Bongomek for instance presented the Commission with a
                        memorandum emphasizing their sense of continued political marginalisation,
                        loss of cultural identity and ethnic victimisation.5

             3.	        The story of identity in Mount Elgon is further complicated by the existence of
                        what are most commonly referred to as the Mosop and the Soy clans. Again,
                        the Commission found this to be a somewhat confusing issue whose nuances
                        may be lost on outsiders. The terms Mosop and Soy are above all geographical
                        descriptions. They describe where people live and not necessarily how they live.
                        The Soy are those from (and of ) the lower reaches of the mountain. It includes
                        the Sabaot but—technically—is not limited to them. Mosop refers to those from
                        further up the mountain specifically from Chepkitale; the desolate moorlands
                        that are found at about 3000 meters. The Mosop consists mainly of the Ogiek
                        who are often considered as another Kalenjin sub-group altogether because of
                        their unique cultural traditions.6 The Ogiek are primarily hunter-gatherers and
                        cattle herders. An Ogiek elder explained them as:

               The Ndorobo community who live above the forest zone and below Mount Elgon.
               These people are cattle herders and beekeepers. There is no crop production. Since
               historical time, they have been feeding on mild, honey and meat and they also used
               to look for food from distant areas of the Soy community.7

4.	        The Ogiek lack of geographic cohesion as well as their tendency to adopt the
           language and customs of their neighbours baffled colonial administrators who
           tried to create specific reserves for them. They have also confounded post-
           colonial efforts to administer and manage them along conventional lines leading
           to recurrent concerns about marginalisation and even outright neglect.8 The
           result has been Mosop as a geographical descriptor means that some Sabaot—
           principally the Kony—also self-identify with this clan. Conversely, the argument
           has been made that the Ogiek are not a distinct Kalenjin sub-group and are
           instead Sabaots who happen to live further up the mountain.

5.	        The fluidity of these identities is reflected in the testimonies heard by the
           Commission. Some witnesses emphasize the idea of a single people divided only
           by the arrival of colonialism:

               The Europeans, they said “This is Mosop and that is Soy”. It was that boundary that
               distinguished the Soy. So, the people were unable to distinguish between the Soy
               and the Mosop. That is why they called the people by the names “Soy” and “Ndorobo”.9

6.	        Other witnesses emphasized the different fractures and cleavages that divided
           Mount Elgon communities amongst themselves and from each other:

               There is no clan called the Soy and there is no clan called the Ndorobo. We have several
               clans in Mount Elgon. The people from the moorland who are Ndorobo have a number
               of clans among them and they are not a clan themselves. The Soy have so many clans;
               almost 100. The word Ndorobo as far I know refers to people who were living in the
               forest.10


7.	        The various Sabaot (and affiliated) communities are the clear majority in Mount
           Elgon. There are also however two significant non-Sabaot minorities: the Bukusu
           and (less numerously) the Teso. The Bukusu and Teso presence on the mountain
           feature prominently in the evolution and unfolding of the SLDF. Their presence
           also stands at the heart of other episodes of ethnic violence over the past two
           decades.

             Mountain
             8.	      Many of Commission’s witnesses took a very long view and described their
                      presence on the mountain as dating back several hundred years or—at the very
                      least—several generations. All the Mount Elgon communities have their own
                      particular understandings about belonging to the mountain. A representative
                      from the Teso community spoke of pre-millennial migrations down the River Nile
                      with eventual settlement in and around the mountain.12 The Bukusu narrative
                      is of a mountain that they refer to as Masaba.13 Sabaot elders expressed
                      similar notions of longevity. Notwithstanding these very long histories,
                      current settlement patterns in Mount Elgon are actually a very recent, colonial
                      phenomenon.

             9.	      Mount Elgon, like so many other parts of Kenya, was profoundly affected by the
                      colonial administration’s decision to open up parts of the country to European
                      settlement. In 1926, a branch of the railway reached Kitale. The region’s temperate
                      climate and fertile soils proved irresistible and soon afterwards Uasin Gishu
                      and Trans Nzoia were set aside exclusively for European use. Indigenes were
                      evicted further westwards into the Kavirondo Native Reserve which included
                      Mount Elgon. This was how many Sabaots found themselves on the mountain.
                      Trans Nzoia and Uasin Gishu were entirely shut off to them except if they took
                      up employment as labourers on European farms. In 1932, there was another
                      critical development with the Carter Land Commission. The Carter Commission
                      represented a seminal attempt to tackle land needs and tenure in colonial
                      Kenya. In Mount Elgon, Carter made the critical decision to create another Native
                      Reserve in the moorlands. The reserve consisted of 40 000 acres at altitude and
                      above the forest belt in Chepkitale. Its occupants consisted of a community that
                      colonialists referred to as the “El Gony” but who are more—as per the discussion
                      above—are more properly described as the Ogiek with (possibly) Bok elements:
                           The Moorland area of Mount Elgon, comprising some 40,000 acres, should be added to
                           the Kavirondo Native Reserve and set aside for the use of the El Gony, who should also
                           be able to find accommodation in other parts of the Kavirondo Native Reserve, or to the
                           extent that the Uganda Government may be willing to accommodate more El Gony in
                           its territory, they should have an option of going there.14

10.	     The residents of Mount Elgon are incredibly conversant with this history. They
         speak eloquently about events that took place nearly eight decades ago and add
         their own personal and pained feelings about the fate that befell them as a result
         of the Carter Commission:
             I can summarize the problems of Mount Elgon in a very short manner. It is based on
             the arrival of the colonial government. Before that the Sabaot were able to look after
             themselves successfully. Unfortunately when the Europeans came, they removed
             them from their ancestral land which is currently known as Trans Nzoia and Bungoma
             including Mount Elgon itself. The Europeans removed Sabaot because they wanted
             to use their land to settle their own Europeans. To do that, they physically removed
             them. They were taken in Uganda as shown in our records. The Sabaots have been
             living under a lot of humiliation. They have been marginalized and persecuted. They
             were prosecuted and dispersed.15

11.	     The Commission also heard from another extraordinary 91 year old witness who
         had even more vivid memories about the demarcation of the Chepkitale reserve:
             After the white settlers came, they said that we were living with animals. They tried to
             put the boundaries between the forest and the land. They took the soil to test it and
             establish where the boundary of the forest was. Those Europeans they put beacons
             to show the boundaries of the Soy and the Mosop. The name “Soy” shows where the
             boundary was. They called the other side “Reserve”.16

12.	     And so Mount Elgon sat for most of the colonial period. The Ogiek were essentially
         marooned close to the top of the mountain in Chepkitale. The rest of the Mount
         Elgon populace—the Bukusu, the various other Sabaot sub-groups and the
         Teso—were scattered throughout the slopes and foothills. A representative
         of the Bukusu community painted a picture of a peaceful coexistence. As he
         described it, ‘before 1963, we were staying happily with our neighbours.’17

13.	     Sabaot elders, however, tell a markedly different tale of increasing unhappiness
         at the apparent Bukusu dominance of the economic and, in particular, political
         life of Mount Elgon. It appears that the majority of chiefs during the colonial
         period were either by accident or design drawn from the Bukusu and larger
         Luhya community to which they belonged. Their administration was far from
         popular with the Sabaot who complained bitterly about corruption as well as
         forced road building and forest clearing campaigns. The powerful chief Murunga
         was particularly hated. Chaffing under Luhya domination, Sabaot elders and
         politicians began to champion the administrative separation of Mount Elgon from

                      on various administrative issues. The RBC eventually turned down Sabaot
                      requests for separation. Elgon remained part of Bungoma.

             14.	     The mountain approached Independence with trepidation. The decision to leave
                      the boundaries unchanged was angrily received. Added to this was a heated
                      political atmosphere occasioned by competition between the two main parties
                      – KANU and KADU – and their ethnically defined constituents. In 1963, violence
                      broke out on the mountain. While the violence went both ways (anti-Bukusu
                      and anti-Sabaot), the Bukusu seemed particularly badly hit. Once again, this is
                      something that current residents continue to remember and speak about with a
                      great deal of pain:
                           In 1963 when we elected the first MP for Mount Elgon, we had clashes. Houses were
                           burnt and cattle stolen, homes were destroyed...From 1961 to 1974, we had the
                           infamous tribal clashes. Those really affected us very much. People were killed, cattle
                           stolen and homes destroyed. During that period, about 556 Bukusus were killed across
                           Mount Elgon and Trans Nzoia and 50 Bukusus displaced. During that time, land was
                           taken by the Sabaots.18

             15.	     It was, as the Commission discovered, an ominous start to the post-colonial history
                      of Mount Elgon.

             Chebyuk Settlement Scheme: Phases I, II and III
             16.	     Identity and land provided the structural underpinnings to the SLDF. The actual
                      catalyst, however, was the Chebyuk Settlement Scheme. Chebyuk has a long,
                      complicated and ultimately unavoidable history that holds the keys to understanding
                      the emergence of a complicated militia.

             17.	     Technically, the story of Chebyuk begins in the mid-1960s when talk began to
                      emerge a scheme to remove the people of Chepkitale from the moorlands and
                      re-settle them on the lower slopes of the mountain. From the outset, however,
                      there had been concerns about Chepkitale’s suitability for human inhabitation.
                      Those concerns were expressed by some colonial administrators in the 1930s
                      with the initial creation of the moorland reserve in the 1930s but they were either
                      ignored or overruled. It would take another three decades for the broad consensus

                                                                                          Vol u m e III   Chapter TWO




         to emerge that it was in everybody’s interests that the move down-mountain be
         implemented. The government would then be able to supply security, health,
         education and roads; the previously unserved Chepkitale people would finally be
         able to access these services. Other priorities also came to the surface with wildlife
         officials pressing for the creation of a national park to showcase the mountain’s
         unique wildlife and vegetation.

18.	     Most Ogiek agree that – attachment to the land aside – life in Chepkitale was
         difficult. An Ogiek elder sketched out an unhappy picture for the Commission:
             These people did not have schools, before and even after Uhuru. When Kenya attained
             independence, these people were forgotten. They were not offered school education
             and from 1963, there were no primary schools in Chepkitale. If it was there, it was only
             one that went up to Standard Three. That was a big problem. There was no hospital, no
             security personnel and because of this, the animals were stolen by the Sebei of Uganda.
             These people had great suffering.19

19.	     Discussions began in 1965 with Ogiek leaders, local district officials and government
         authorities coming together to plan for the move. In 1968, a notice was published
         in Kenya Gazette. Implementation had to follow. A few hold-outs in Chepkitale
         opposed the relocation and spoke openly about ‘not wanting to move’ but the
         terms of the notice were unequivocal: the moors had been closed off.20

Chebyuk Phase I
20.	     On the face of it, Chebyuk appeared straightforward: the relocation of a relatively
         small community for sound, legitimate and developmentally-oriented reasons.
         Indeed, the government had already deeply invested in resettling the landless, the
         displaced and many thousands of others washed up in the wake of colonialism. The
         reality of Chebyuk’s implementation was, however, very far from straightforward.
         The whole scheme was ineptly and inexpertly handled from the very beginning.
         Both the wider research and Commission witnesses make this perfectly clear.
         Trouble started with a giant sized legal loophole. In 1971, about 460 families (3800
         people) were moved from Chepkitale before and without official degazettement of
         Chebyuk which therefore remained part of the forest and unlicensed. In essence,
         people were moved into a settlement that did not actually exist.

21.	     Because degazettement had not taken place, plots could not be demarcated and title
         deeds could be issued. The result was an unruly free-for-all. People assigned themselves
         plots with each family apparently claiming 20 acre spreads as per government promises

                      made when the scheme was first announced. Families with no titles then proceeded to
                      sub-divide and re-sell their self-claimed allocations. The main recipients/beneficiaries
                      of this redistribution were Soy locals and neighbours who had helped in the clearing
                      of forest. Chebyuk also attracted huge numbers of people who had not been included
                      in the original plans. Landless Soy families who had missed out on nearby settlement
                      schemes in Trans Nzoia streamed into Chebyuk hoping to benefit from the lack of legal
                      structure to install themselves on plots of land.

             22.	     A Commission witness summarized the chaos of the entire exercise:
                           The movement of the Ndorobo to the Chebyuk Settlement Scheme did not take place
                           when it was conceived in 1965 because of logistics. The Ndorobo as they were referred to
                           were moved in 1971 by the then Government. Allow me now to say that the Government
                           did not do its work because it never identified how much land out of the forest was
                           going to be allocated to these Ndorobo. So the excision exercise did not take place. The
                           Government did not appoint a Commission or a Committee which was credible to settle
                           those people. The Government left those people to settle themselves.21

             23.	     The witness elaborated on the unauthorized entrenchment of the Soy in Chebyuk:
                            What happened is that they invited their brothers the Soy to clear the forest because
                           this was forest land. Some of them decided to sell certain pieces of land to facilitate
                           themselves to till the land. The Government did not facilitate them. This is how the Soy
                           came in. However, that is not the only way the Soy entered Mount Elgon. There are those
                           who bought land in the so-called Mount Elgon Chebyuk Settlement Scheme from the
                           Ndorobo. When Chebyuk Settlement Scheme was taking shape, there were pockets of
                           land which were left as islands in the proposed scheme. Some of them are the current
                           Cheptoror. The Soy people grabbed land and settled themselves. The current Cheptoror
                           was then referred to as Shauri Yako. The reason for this was because they had not been
                           allocated the land.22

             24.	     Degazettement eventually took place in 1974. Six thousand five hundred hectares
                      were officially sliced out of the forest to create Chebyuk Settlement Scheme.

             Chebyuk Phase II
             25.	     Chebyuk Phase One and the three year delay involved in its establishment left a lot
                      of unhappy people in its wake. Nobody seemed entirely satisfied with the way that
                      things had turned out. The biggest problem was a large constituency of people
                      believed that they had been unfairly shut out of the scheme. The disgruntled
                      included Soy who claimed that they had either been given or had bought land

                                                                                       Vol u m e III   Chapter TWO




         from the Mosop and had been wrongly overlooked and subsequently evicted by
         the committee that had decided on final allocations in Phase One. There were
         also those who had simply allocated themselves large tracts of land in Chebyuk;
         they had lived there for many years and wanted their squatter and user rights
         recognized.

26.	     While they were the primary beneficiaries of the scheme, the Mosop began to
         take a much harder line on Chebyuk land. The twenty acres per family apparently
         agreed upon when the scheme was first announced do not seem to have
         materialized with each household eventually receiving much less land than
         they had anticipated. Another of their main arguments became that the 6500
         hectares that they had been allocated in Chebyuk was inadequate compensation
         for 35 000 hectares they had lost in Chepkitale. Indeed, some even tried to move
         back up into the moorlands even though Chepkitale had been turned into a
         game reserve in 1968 and thus not licensed for human activity and settlement.
         They were forcefully and violently evicted by administration police. The Mosop
         also turned their attention to the presence of Soy and other so-called outsiders
         within Chebyuk itself who had bought or otherwise acquired land in the scheme.
         They demanded this land back. The Soi (and to a lesser extent Bukusu and Teso)
         who had bought land from the Mosop counter-demanded their money back and,
         failing that, simply refused to move. A Commission witness described Mosop
         unhappiness with the situation that prevailed in the late 1970s and early 1980s:
             In 1979, the Government went and chased those who had remained in Chepkitale.
             During this process some of the animals were shot and killed. In the 1980s when we
             were in Chebyuk, the rulers who were imposed on us ruled us ruthlessly. They were
             predominantly from the Soi community. We suffered greatly because we had no chief,
             no political leader and we were ruled ruthlessly.23

27.	     Although the Commission has been unable to establish the specifics, a series
         of petitions and representations were made concerning the situation in
         Chebyuk. Eventually in 1979 President Moi set aside yet more land for additional
         settlement. This is what became known as Chebyuk Phase Two. It came as no
         surprise to the Commission that many of the same problems that bedevilled
         Phase One manifested in Phase Two. The legal framework required to anchor
         the settlement (degazettement) was entirely non-existent. There was also no
         clear understanding as to how the land would be divided amongst the many
         different claimants. The perennial issue of squatters and the apparent buyers
         of Mount Elgon also could not be addressed. As such, the 1980s were tense
         and difficult years in Chepyuk. Some Commission witnesses have spoken about

                      sporadic outbreaks of violence (burning of huts and assaults) as threats flew back
                      and forth the various communities.

             28.	     In 1988, a delegation of Mosop elders met with President Moi and presented him
                      with a memorandum outlining their many concerns about the land situation in
                      Mount Elgon. They expressed deep anxieties about the adjudication and allocation
                      in Chepyuk Phase Two accusing the local Member of Parliament, Mr. Wilberforce
                      Kisiero and a local chief of corrupting the process for the benefit of their families,
                      friends and associates.24 The President responded by stripping Mr. Kiseiro of his
                      Assistant Ministerial position at the Ministry of Education. He then announced
                      the appointment of a team to re-evaluate and streamline the allocation of land in
                      both Chebyuk Phase One and Phase Two. That team consisted of Mr. Lekolool (who
                      was at this point the Commissioner of Western Province), Mr. Changole (District
                      Commissioner Bungoma) and a Mr. Muchumbet (a government surveyor). They
                      began work in early 1989.

             29.	     Twenty years on, Mr. Lekolool is still regarded as a controversial and divisive figure
                      amongst some sections of the Mount Elgon population. He was described by a
                      Commission witness as one of the people responsible for the ‘evil’ of Chebyuk.25 By
                      most descriptions, anecdotal and academic, Lekoolol’s intervention was dramatic.
                      All the Chepyuk allocations and self-allocations were annulled. The entire process
                      would begin all over again. A vetting committee was created and applications invited
                      afresh. Predictably, the number of applicants far exceeded the amount of land
                      available. Perennial claimants to Chebyuk land, the Mosop and the Soy, put in their
                      claims. There was also a rush of interest from people from many other communities;
                      their applications were based on long term settlement by virtue of having worked or
                      having bought the land. With no other way to balance the amount of land available
                      against the number of applicants, Lekolool’s committee introduced balloting which
                      reduced the entire allocation process to a kind of raffle; those whose names and
                      numbers came up counted themselves lucky. The Committee also capped land
                      parcel sizes at 2 hectares as way of admitting larger numbers into the scheme.
                      At the end of the exercise, a group of Mosop was settled mainly in the Cheptoror
                      and Kaimugul areas of the scheme. The Soy received scattered plots throughout
                      Chepyuk. The vast majority, however, could not prove ownership. They were evicted
                      from their land along with those could prove ownership but had no luck in the
                      balloting. Entire families were uprooted. Landless, people drifted to urban centres
                      such as Kapsakwony, Cheptais and – further afield – Bungoma, Kitale and Webuye.
             24	 Mr. Kiseiro’s testimony before the Commission was that he was ‘quite happy to be out of Government’. He also accepted that there
                 were many in Mount Elgon who regarded him as contributing to ‘delays’ in the regularization of the scheme. TJRC/Hansard/Public

30.	     It was a violent and unsettled time on parts of Mount Elgon. Some residents
         blamed Mr. Lekolool personally for both the fact and the manner of their eviction
         from Chebyuk:
             PC Lekolool chased away those people who had lived in the forest. When this happened,
             they burnt people’s properties and brought people from Mosop and put them in
             Cheptoror. They closed every path and said it was a forest where trees would be planted.
             After they planted trees, we went there and cried wondering what had happened yet we
             happened to have been given the land by the Government.26

31.	     The former Provincial Commissioner has a very different understanding of the part
         he played in Chebyuk. His story was of overseeing a relatively smooth, amicable
         and ultimately successful settlement process. Mr. Lekoolol rejected the claim that
         he controlled the notorious vetting committees that prepared the lists that in turn,
         determined eligibility for the ballot:
             When I went there, I went for meetings with the committee and asked for the list. We
             went through the list in big organized barazas. It was not secretly done; it was publicly
             done. Therefore, to identify them we were using their own people. Of course, a person
             like me coming from another area would not know who is a Ndorobo and who is a Soy.
             So we used their own people to identify the genuine Ndorobo. They did exactly that
             and came up with that list. We then organized them in a way that they balloted in a
             transparent way. That is how we settled them.27

32.	     He further rejected the idea of animosity between him and Mount Elgon people. If
         anything the former Provincial Commissioner spoke of a very friendly relationship
         rooted in a successful resettlement:
             That was a clean job and if you went to the top that mountain, you will find children
             who have been born and named “Lekolool”. Can you give a child the name of an enemy?
             He must have been friendly. So, Lekolool was a very friendly man who settled them
             properly and they appreciated it and named their children after me.28

33.	     The only failing that Mr. Lekolool would admit to was a delay in the issuance
         of title deeds and various other documents necessary to confirm ownership.
         Even then he would not accept personal blame for this in that such delays were
         inherent to government and that Chebyuk’s difficult terrain made for difficult
         delineation:
             Documentation is done by balloting and then records are set up for settlement and
             issuing of title deeds. It takes a bit of time to identify plots for individual settlers. It took
             a long time because it is a forested place and it was not easy to access the place and

                      satisfied with the outcome of his intervention in the long-running Chebyuk saga.
                      As far as was concerned, everyone was a ‘winner’ and he departed certain that
                      the people of the mountain were finally enjoying the ‘fruits’ of independence.30

             Chebyuk Phase III
             35.	     In January 1993 two minibuses full of elders and local notables motored out of
                      Mount Elgon. Their destination and mission were familiar ones: an appointment
                      with President Moi to discuss the perennially thorny issue of Chebyuk settlement
                      scheme. The elders and notables represented an equally familiar group of
                      petitioners. Chebyuk Phase Two had created a bad-tempered cocktail of losers
                      easily recognized by the Commission. One ingredient in this cocktail consisted
                      of the group of people who since the 1970s and the advent of Chebyuk I, had
                      (often illegally) carved out sizeable farms for themselves and their families.
                      Some of these farms were very large indeed (80 hectares); their owners were
                      forced to downsize under Lekolool’s arrangement. Another ingredient was the
                      group of people whose numbers did not come up in the balloting at all. They
                      missed out completely on the chance to be settled in Chebyuk. All belonged
                      to the very large group of hopefuls that had grown up around the successive
                      attempts to redistribute and resettle Chebyuk. Once again, their petitions
                      were well received by President Moi. The creation of Chebyuk Phase Three in the
                      locales of Chepkurkur and Korng’otuny was announced.

             36.	     The central problem with Chebyuk Phase Three was that as with Phase Two,
                      the scheme was introduced into an area already characterized by different
                      forms of land occupation. Moreover as soon as Phase Three was announced, it
                      attracted a slew of newcomers intent upon formulating their own claims to the
                      land. Typically, inertia, confusion and delays set in. At some point the District
                      Commissioner, a Christopher Munguti, attempted to jump-start matters by
                      apparently preparing residents for the infamous and much despised process
                      of balloting. Some kind of preliminary survey was conducted. The Commission
                      is unclear about Mr Munguti’s actual role. Testimonies heard suggest that it
                      was a high-handed one. One witness claimed that at some point in 1998, Mr.
                      Munguti carried out ‘balloting for Chebyuk III at Kapsakwony at the office’

50           REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION
                                                                                                                    Vol u m e III    Chapter TWO




         and that was the means by which ‘so many people were issued with balloting
         papers for Chebyuk III.’31 Others described Munguti’s actions in even more
         sinister terms:
              Another DC by the name Munguti returned evil again into Chebyuk. They brought
              the map and asked the people to ballot for their land using the map. The land they
              were asking people to ballot for was already occupied by other people. Once you had
              participated in the ballot, the surveyors were instructed to go and remove the person
              who was already on the farm.32

37.	     These attempts at surveying and purported evictions inspired yet another visit to
         see President Moi in Eldoret. Mr. Munguti’s handling of Chepyuk Phase Three was
         apparently the main topic of discussion:
              We met President Moi at Eldoret where we informed him about the problems we were
              facing. President Moi was so surprised. He said: “I had given you this land, who is this
              one that is again interfering with the map?” We told him it was DC Munguti. He asked
              us where DC Munguti came from. We told him we did not know. He said: “I have heard,”
              and we then came back.33

38.	     Soon afterwards, District Commissioner Munguti was transferred out of Mount
         Elgon. Chebyuk residents attributed the transfer to intervention by the President.
         The process started again with a much clearer focus on the matter and task at
         hand: 1732 (mainly Soy) families to be settled on 3464 hectares of land.34 This
         worked out to individual plot sizes of 2 hectares each.

39.	     In the early 2000s, government machinery finally moved into action. For many
         of the same reasons already explained, surveying was a slow and difficult
         process that ran into a number of headwinds including the emergence of a
         campaign known as Nyumba kwa Nyumba. The chief proponent of Nyumba
         kwa Nyumba was the then member of parliament, Mr. John Serut. Nyumba kwa
         Nyumba was a stand borne out the fiercely competitive politics of Mount Elgon
         which will be discussed shortly. It is best understood as a call for usufructuary
         rights to be recognised during the survey and allocation. In other words,
         people would be allocated whatever land they were using and had claimed
         as their own despite the fact that some of these plots were many times larger
         than the two hectares that the government intended. Serut is said to have
         advised people to sit tight and to regard that the survey as a mere formality

                                         REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION                                          51

                      that would eventually confirm their ownership of the land. Indeed, many of
                      his constituents voted for him in the 2002 election on the basis that he had
                      promised to ‘assist’ them to resolve the land issue.35

             40.	     In his depositions on Nyumba kwa Nyumba before the Commission, Mr. Serut
                      stepped back from his trenchant stand of a decade ago. Nyumba kwa Nyumba,
                      was both misstated and misunderstood and that it was never his intention
                      to suggest that each, any and all residents of Chebyuk would be allocated
                      their particular patch of land. That, he argued would result in very small and
                      unproductive plots: a ‘slum’ of little agricultural and economic value. Serut’s
                      current explanations of Nyumba kwa Nyumba maintain that was meant only
                      as a general call for a legitimate survey that respected the rights of ‘genuine’,
                      long-term squatters:
                           So, what did I mean? I meant this: proper procedures were to be followed.
                           Identification of the genuine people to be settled and; thereafter, those who were
                           already on the ground, should be settled on the same piece of land, not to be
                           moved. So, after vetting, the list should be re-vetted for the people on the ground.
                           If you are already on the ground, it only made sense that you are returned to
                           the same piece of land. That is what I called “Nyumba kwa Nyumba”. Not a man
                           coming to squat on land and within two days and then you are told now you have
                           ownership of land.36

             41.	 Misinterpreted or not, Nyumba kwa Nyumba was an immensely popular
                  position that captured many residents’ aspirations. In 2005, however, there
                  was a drastic re-drawing of Chebyuk Phase Two and two very important
                  adjustments were made. Both these adjustments, as the Commission was
                  told, would have stunning consequences. The first was that the size of the
                  allocations would be halved from two hectares to just one. The second was
                  that the allocations would be shared evenly between the Soy and the Mosop:
                  866 plots for the Soy and 866 for the Mosop.

             42.	     The entire character of the settlement scheme changed very quickly. It is not
                      entirely clear to the Commission why the changes were so rapidly introduced.
                      The dominant view in Mount Elgon is that this was a purely political decision
                      designed to reward and punish the Mosop and Soy respectively for positions
                      they took during a constitutional referendum in November 2005. The
                      referendum, a national one, had deeply local reverberations in Mount Elgon
                      for reasons that will be discussed shortly. Mr. Serut’s evidence threw some

                                   Hon. John Serut testifying before the Commission at a Public hearing



         light on how the changes were brought about. They were apparently the
         product of discussions and planning between the Provincial Commissioner,
         Abdul Mwasserah, and various community leaders. Mr. Serut’s representation
         was that initially, the process was a smooth and an inclusive one that
         produced a list of worthy, deserving and legitimate beneficiaries:

             They were very patient. They went through the process peacefully and involved
             and engaged the community properly. When we identified the land, we agreed that
             to identify those who should be beneficiaries, we should use the panel of elders.
             The panel of elders did its work and in a priority manner. The Ndorobo were told
             to get 50 per cent and the Soy 50 per cent. We also agreed that those who would
             be identified as beneficiaries, the list to be held for one month for the public to
             ventilate and find out whether the people who had been undeserving. When this
             list had been hung for one month, nobody raised a finger against anybody to say
             that he or she did not deserve.37

43.	     This list, uncontroversial in Serut’s eyes, in effect sounded the clarion call. Long
         simmering elements finally consolidated into the fighting force that was the
         SLDF.

Volume III   Chapter TWO




             The Politics of the Mountain
             44.	     Land and ethnicity explained the underlying cause and eventual emergence
                      of SLDF. They do not, however, fully explain the timing of the militia or
                      provide a complete answer for why the group activated when it did. For an
                      understanding of timing, the Commission turned to the politics, politicians
                      and political cycles of Mount Elgon. The question of Mount Elgon land was
                      deeply politicized. From the local to the national to the presidential, politicians
                      of all hues were drawn into knotty issue that was Chebyuk settlement scheme.
                      Parliamentary politics though have had the greatest impact.

             45.	     Mount Elgon’s politics conform to Kenyan politics in that—as is explained in
                      another section of this report—they are broadly ethnic. Politicians and their
                      parties mobilize primarily along ethnic lines. What this meant was that for
                      many years Mount Elgon constituency has been represented by a member
                      of parliament from the majority Sabaot community. In turn, Mount Elgon
                      representatives have without exception aligned themselves with the larger
                      Kalenjin bloc and whatever political party housed them. Daniel Moss of KANU
                      was the first politician to represent the mountain in Independent Kenya. He
                      was a trenchant supporter of Sabaot land rights and a prime mover behind
                      the establishment of Chebyuk in the mid-1960s. The same can be said of his
                      successor Wilberforce Kisiero who appeared before the Commission to make
                      a lengthy and passionate submission about mistreatment of his people since
                      ‘time immemorial’.38

             46.	     Even after Kenya became a multi- party state in 1992, Mount Elgon continued to
                      vote KANU. Again, the rationale was largely ethnic. Mount Elgon voters fed into the
                      larger Kalenjin vote that supported KANU and President Moi. Despite the fact that
                      Mount Elgon was a KANU zone the politics of the region were extremely competitive
                      and were (until 2007) geared towards securing the KANU nomination; the winner
                      of the KANU nomination was essentially guaranteed a trouble free journey to
                      parliament. In 1997, Wilberforce Kisiero was succeeded by Joseph Kimkung. He
                      was another Sabaot but from the less politically prolific Kony sub-group.

             47.	     Without individualizing the Mount Elgon issue, the Commission has attributed
                      much of the animosity, venom and degeneration of the region into a very
                      difficult relationship between two competing politicians who have both
                      represented the constituency in parliament: Fred Kapondi and John Serut.

54           REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION
                                                                                           Vol u m e III   Chapter TWO




         In 2002, John Serut rose to the pinnacle of Mount Elgon politics defeating
         the incumbent Joseph Kimkung. Mr. Serut came to politics from the Ministry
         of Lands where he used to work as a registrar. There was of course nothing
         accidental or coincidental about this. He presented himself to the electorate
         as someone with a technical understanding of land issues. The importance
         of land on the mountain means Elgon politicians structure their campaigns
         around promises to deliver farms into the waiting arms of the landless. One of
         the messages of his campaign was that allocations at Chepyuk III would finally
         be settled to the advantage of all concerned especially his supporters: the
         Sabaot. The Nyumba kwa Nyumba campaign was a reflection of this popular
         and populist stand. As the sitting Member of Parliament, Mr. Serut’s sentiments
         carried great weight and some of the Commission’s witnesses described their
         great pride in a leader who was finally standing up for the poor and landless of
         Mount Elgon.39

48.	     Mount Elgon, however did not exist in a vacuum. It lay against the broader
         tableau of national politics. And in 2005, there was no more important issue
         in 2005 than the referendum on the adoption of a new constitution. Mr. Serut
         was awkwardly placed for this historic referendum. In February 2004, he had
         sensationally defected from KANU to FORD-Kenya, at that point a party of the
         opposition. At a rally attended by such FORD-Kenya big wigs as Mukhisa Kituyi,
         Musikari Kombo and Moses Wetangula described KANU as a vehicle that has
         ‘stalled along the way’.40 It was an extra-ordinary move given that FORD-Kenya
         was almost completely dominated by Bukusu politicians who were regarded as
         the long-term enemies of Sabaot ambitions. Predictably, Mr. Serut’s flirtation
         with FORD-Kenya did not last very long. Within months, he was back in the KANU
         fold and took the lead in championing the “Yes” campaign for KANU and other
         government affiliated parties in the 2005 constitutional referendum.

49.	     Mr. Serut’s support for the “Yes” camp (symbolized by a banana, “No” by an orange)
         was unabashed. He traversed Mount Elgon enthusiastically campaigning for a
         variety of social and ideological reasons:
              I told them to vote for “Yes”. The issue of women marrying women and men marrying
              men; these were allegations and did not exist in that draft. Whether it was called the
              Wako Draft or whatever draft, it was none of our business! That is what I told my people
              as a leader. I told them that they did not elect me to Parliament to go eat and forget
              them. I had to guide them.41

Volume III   Chapter TWO




             50.	     But Mr. Serut had made a serious political miscalculation and had not read his
                      constituents or the national mood correctly. He found himself on the wrong end
                      of a number of powerful current and former KANU politicians who supported the
                      “No” campaign and subsequently joined the Orange Democratic Movement that
                      was birthed by opposition to this particular effort to revamp Kenya’s constitution.
                      Mount Elgon, despite Mr. Serut’s best efforts, fell firmly in the “No” camp.

             51.	     Mount Elgon’s “No” vote had fall out had lasting consequences for the open running
                      sore that was Chebyuk. Mr. Serut explained his defence of proposed constitution
                      in high-flowing moral and ethical terms such as opposition to same-sex marriage.
                      The Commission, however, heard consistent evidence that in fact, he ran a hard-
                      nosed and nakedly political campaign during which he linked the regularization
                      of Chebyuk land to voting “Yes”. Ominously, he linked voting no with dire and
                      unpleasant consequences. At a rally held in the wake of the referendum and Mount
                      Elgon’s resounding “No” vote, Mr. Serut was heard chastising constituents for refusing
                      to ‘follow bees for honey’ and instead choosing to ‘follow flies and [to] eat human
                      waste’.42 On another occasion, he was said to have issued ominously crude threats
                      to no campaigners: “Wanaume mtakimbia mpaka uume wenu urudi ndani” which
                      translates as ‘men you will run until your manhood will disappear.’43

             52.	 Mr. Serut denied dangling settlement in Chebyuk in front of voters as an
                  inducement for voting yes. His explanation was that he had tried to present a
                  vote for the constitution as a vote for development and government in general:
                           I told my people that, whether this referendum was going to succeed or not,
                           we were to be on the right side so that we benefit. The right side was the child
                           holding bread. That is the language we were using...What I was interested in was
                           development. I told them; let us vote for “Yes”. I told them not to follow promises
                           which would not work. 44

             53.	     Mount Elgon, however, voted no. Almost immediately, drastic changes were
                      introduced into Chebyuk Phase Three. As has been explained above, a scheme
                      that was seen as being previously reserved for the Soy now had to admit the
                      Mosop. The popular explanation in Mount Elgon for this redistribution was that,
                      in Serut’s terms, the Mosop had chased the bees. In other words, the Mosop
                      had supported the referendum and even though the cause was a losing one,
                      they were still rewarded with—as it were--the honey. In the process, Mr. Serut
                      began to emerge as a champion of sorts for the Mosop seeking to be considered
                      and included in the allocation of land at Chepyuk. Serut’s co-option of Mosop
                      causes would cost him the support of the majority Soy who gradually came

         to believe that he no longer represented their interests. As one Commission
         witness bluntly put it, ‘by that time, our MP, Honourable Serut, had become our
         enemy.’45 And with a general election fast approaching in 2007, an alternative
         had to be found. This, roughly, was the milieu that Fred Chesebe Kapondi
         stepped into. It was a milieu in which land and specifically Chebyuk land had
         acquired an overtly political sheen.

54.	     Mr. Kapondi was no stranger either to Mr. Serut or to the rough and tumble
         world of Mount Elgon politics. Mr. Serut himself describes Mr. Kapondi as a
         relative through marriage to his first cousin and a kind of dependent for whom he
         paid rent and whom he had helped to find employment when he was younger.46
         At some point, Mr. Kapondi even campaigned on behalf of Mr. Serut. Fred Kapondi
         describes his own political career as stretching back over two decades in capacities
         and parties that typify the broad ebb and flow of Mount Elgon politics:
              I was a force in Mount Elgon politics from 1992. As a young man in 1992 with a lot of
              energy and without resources, I believed in myself that I could make it to Parliament. I
              managed to crisscross Mount Elgon from Cheptais to Kaboiywo on foot. In fact, in 1992,
              I believed I won the election but was rigged out. Everybody believed I won the election
              but was rigged out. I have been having very faithful followers across Mount Elgon
              District from 1992. Again in 1997, I was a candidate and lost by a whisker. [In 2002]...I
              stood on a Ford People ticket. I was working then with Hon. Nyachae.47

55.	     After losing yet again in the General Elections of 2002, (this time to Serut) Kapondi
         seemed to retreat somewhat. By his own admission, he accepted that he could not
         compete with Serut’s popularity:
              My message was not popular. The message by Hon. Serut of Nyumba kwa Nyumba was
              very appealing. I had played my part. The people had voted for Mr. Serut...I had played
              my part and the rest was up to Mr. Serut and the people. In any case, I did not have any
              elective post.48

56.	     But Mr. Kapondi did not sit out for long. By 2005 he was back on the campaign trail
         for the constitutional referendum. Astutely, Kapondi did not loan his weight and
         influence to the sinking ship that was the Banana/”Yes” campaign. Instead, he
         hit the road on behalf of the “No” camp:
              During the referendum, Mr. Serut was campaigning for banana camp while we were
              campaigning for the orange camp. He made it very clear particularly to the people of
              Phase III that if they were not going to vote for “banana camp”, they would face the
              consequences.

Volume III   Chapter TWO




             57.	     Unlike Mr. Serut, Mr. Kapondi was neatly placed with the triumph of the Orange/No
                      vote against the proposed constitution. Two fortuitous trends seemed to combine.
                      The first concerned the fall-out from the re-drawing of Chebyuk. There was a large
                      group of Soy malcontents who had either been locked out of the scheme altogether
                      or stood to lose huge swathes of land on account of the 2.5 hectares cap. Soy elders
                      who were shell-shocked and disappointed in Mr. Serut’s betrayal of their cause
                      began to look around for someone else to represent them in the upcoming
                      elections. This group of elders included Patrick Komon (Wilfred Matakwei’s
                      father) and Jason Psongoywo Manyiror who was one of the largest land owners
                      in region. In Mr. Kapondi they found an ideal candidate. Quite apart from his
                      recent break with the hated Serut, Mr. Kapondi had a long and documented
                      history of working for Sabaot and particularly Soy land rights. The elders and
                      those with long memories remembered that as KANU chairman, he had been
                      part of a Sabaot delegation that had visited President Moi in 1989 and 1993 to
                      present their claims for additional land.

             58.	     The second trend was more political. After a few years in the political wilderness,
                      Kapondi found himself as part of the “No” campaign that eventually transformed
                      itself into a formal political party—the Orange Democratic Movement(ODM)—
                      right in time for the electoral cycle of 2007. Mr. Kapondi became, as it were,
                      the face of ODM in the region. As a Commission witness explained, it was a
                      hugely popular move that catapulted Kapondi to new heights in Mount Elgon
                      politics and more or less confirmed him as the next member of parliament for
                      the constituency:
                           When the people refused the Banana Camp, a second rally for ODM was held
                           courtesy of Kapondi. People really supported ODM. They sang with him in joy.
                           They decided that he is the one they were going to chose. If Serut came with his
                           rally, Kapondi would do the same with his ODM supporters. Kapondi was not very
                           popular, but when he got into ODM he became very popular.49

             59.	     Mr. Kapondi’s campaign for the Mount Elgon seat in the General Election of 2007
                      was an extraordinary one. The reason for this was that on the 13 April 2007 he
                      was arraigned in court on charges of robbery with violence for the killing
                      of a Jackson Kaibei Matei on the 17 of August 2006 after robbing him of 55,
                      000 shillings in cash and one cow worth 10,000 shillings while armed with an
                      AK47 rifle. He was also charged with the wilful destruction of property, and
                      promotion of war-like activities. Kapondi’s position was that the charges were
                      false, trumped up and politically motivated. He accused the then area Member
                      of Parliament, Serut, of capitalizing on insecurity in the district to harass
                      his political opponents. He remained in police custody for seven months.

         Kapondi found himself in the absolutely unusual position of running both his
         nomination and parliamentary campaign from Bungoma Prison where he was
         held for several months.

60.	     The Kenyan press was intrigued by the unusualness of Kapondi’s situation and
         conducted a number of interviews. Kapondi portrayed himself as a young, self-made
         man only interested in the growth and development of a poor and marginalized
         area. He also touched on other issues such as improving the distribution of the
         Constituency Development Fund, Local Authorities Transfer and bursaries money.
         His campaign was progressive and forward looking. His slogan was Uongonzi
         Bora ni Ufunguo wa Amani na Maendeleo which translates as ‘Good leadership is
         the key to peace and progress’.50 With the help of his wife and various political
         operatives on the outside Kapondi produced posters and t-shirts and all the other
         paraphernalia that accompany campaigns in modern Kenya.

61.	     The Commission heard extensive testimonies harking to another much darker
         under-current to Mr. Kapondi’s run for the parliamentary. The recurrent claim is
         of a campaign with close connections to the SLDF, its members and associates.
         Mr. Kapondi’s eventual success in both for the ODM nomination and for the 2007
         campaign has therefore been credited to the ruthless elimination and intimidation
         of his rivals by people who are believed to have been SLDF fighters. Mr. Sammy
         Chemwei who was also contesting the Mount Elgon seat felt the wrath of these
         SLDF elements. Mr. Chemwei’s home was set on fire by a large group of masked
         men all armed with AK47 rifles; these were all interpreted as hallmarks of the SLDF.
         In a subsequent interview with the Nation newspaper, Chemwei said that he had
         been threatened by a man who was known and wanted by the police.51 He was
         threatened, apparently, after refusing to step down for Mr. Kapondi. Various ODM
         civic aspirants including Moses Makoit of Cheptais ward and Nathan Warsama of
         Sasur ward and Benson Chesiskaki of Emai ward were all said to have benefited
         from SLDF-orchestrated violence. Claims have also been made that SLDF elements
         contributed to help Mr. Kapondi raise 100 000 shilling nomination fees required
         for contesting the ODM ticket. Mr. Kapondi’s legal proceedings in Webuye have
         also been described as an opportunity for the SLDF to demonstrate its support for
         him. Militiamen supposedly showed up almost every day to listen to the hearings.
         Mount Elgon women were also forced to attend and to sing, dance and ululate:
              All the ladies would be picked up by force to go to Webuye to listen to Mheshimiwa’s case.
              They would want you to sing and do all things on the road. We were being monitored by
              the SLDF. Matakwei would call and ask how we were performing.52

             62.	     On the 13th of December 2007, the state entered a nolle prosequi. It was just two
                      weeks before the General Election. Mr. Kapondi portrays this timing as suspicious
                      and indicative of his initial position that there had been a political motive behind
                      his arrest: ‘The objective was one – just to keep me in until after elections’.53 Riding
                      the ODM wave, Mr. Kapondi easily won the elections, defeating the incumbent MP
                      and ruling Party of National Unity (PNU) candidate, his arch rival Mr. Serut.

             63.	     Kapondi has portrayed Serut as the force behind his legal woes as part of a longer
                      campaign to discredit him in the face of mounting violence in Elgon. In one particularly
                      bitter parliamentary exchange on the 4 April 2007, Mr. Serut accused William Ruto,
                      Musa Sirma, Jebii Kilimo, Charles Keter and Franklin Bett of bankrolling Mr. Kapondi
                      and his supporters as they killed and displaced Mount Elgon residents. Serut claimed
                      in what one parliamentary writer described as ‘thunderous tones’ that he
                           had evidence that Mr. Ruto, Bett, Kilimo and Sirma have been to Elgon to incite people to
                           kill one another. In fact Mr Ruto told my people to reject the allocations in Chebyuk so
                           that when ODM-K government comes into place, they will allocate them the whole
                           forest.54

             64.	     There was uproar in the House. Mr. Raila Odinga and Mr. Charles Keter rose on
                      points of order asking Mr. Serut to substantiate his utterances. Jebii Kilimo and
                      Franklin Bett took issue with Serut’s comment noting that they had gone to the
                      area to address the plight of suffering women and children. Mr. Ruto too was
                      having none of it. He jumped to his feet to describe Mr. Serut as ‘a person who
                      pretends’.55 Mr. Ruto said that Serut was doing nothing about police beatings
                      and burning of homes in Mount Elgon because inaction suited his political
                      goals and that of the government he (Serut) was part of.

             65.	     On the issue of SLDF support for his 2007 campaign, Mr. Kapondi was categorical
                      that this was not the case. His claim is that while he knew some of the militia’s
                      members by virtue of being a public figure in Mount Elgon, he had never benefitted
                      from either SLDF money or violence as has so frequently been claimed:
                           It sounds very ridiculous and very unfortunate for somebody in his right sense to say
                           that Kapondi was handed over the seat by the SLDF. The SLDF never created me. I was
                           in politics before. I was a formidable force in politics in Mount Elgon without the SLDF.
                           To allude to that is sheer nonsense. 56

Chepkurur and Korng’otuny Community Based
Organization
66.	     The Commission took this small community based organization (CBO) as the final
         element responsible for the emergence of the SLDF. The CBO was formed in or
         around 2002 when intense discussions about the fate of Chebyuk III were being held.
         Its main goal of the organization has been explained as furthering Sabaot land rights
         at a time when arguments about rationalizing Chebyuk were gathering momentum:
             The CBO was established to educate people about the problems encountered. The CBO
             was also supposed to tell the Government about the land problem in Chepkurur. It was
             one way of looking for money to enable the organization to go on with its programs and
             also to ask politicians from the area to help. The organization was also intended to go to
             court and seek redress.57

67.	     The main members of this CBO were drawn from a very specific and distinctive
         group. Commission witnesses have described them as ‘Soy elders’ but what they
         were the men who had owned huge farms by virtue of having allegedly grabbed
         and settled upon land in the early 1970s when Chebyuk Phase One was first
         announced.58 Men like Patrick Komon and Jason Psongoywo Manyiror Tirop a
         Soy laibon or ritual specialist were the long-term owners of 100 and 200 hectares
         of Chebyuk land and formed the core of group that stood to lose most from the
         successive attempts to regularize ownership of land in Mount Elgon. These men
         were unapologetic in their holding on to such vast spreads. As Mr. Manyiror
         explained, the land was theirs and had always been;
             The farm belonged to my father. That is where I was born. It was not possible for
             anybody to go into that land because it was my grandfather’s farm. I was on that farm
             together with my children and stayed there without any complaint. I had no problem
             with anybody. Nobody accused me and I did not have any boundary problems. It is
             jealousy which has brought animosity.59

68.	     The CBO claimed to be entirely peaceful in its goals, methods and aspirations. The
         CBO seemed to concern itself mainly with the raising of monies to further their
         campaign and to file court cases meant to protect Sabaot land interests using legal
         and legitimate means. In 2004, members filed an injunction in Eldoret seeking
         to halt renewed surveying in Chebyuk Phase Three. What became of the case is
         unclear. Some witnesses claimed that it was thrown out; others that it collapsed.
         At any rate, disenchantment with Kenya’s slow-moving and unresponsive judicial
         system had set in. Over the next couple of years, the CBO and its members gradually

                                      REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION                    61
Volume III   Chapter TWO




                     became less civic- minded. Some of its members were engaged in violent crimes
                     including robbery, murder, threats and intimidation against people who did not
                     support Sabaot claims. There is also some evidence that people were being
                     coerced to contribute money to pay for the CBO’s running and upkeep. Others
                     have spoken of purchasing and stockpiling of weapons.60

             69.	    In 2005, the CBO was yet again spurred into action. The Mount Elgon District
                     Commissioner, James Ole Serian, had announced the resumption of another
                     round of surveying. Having exhausted all their legal options, CBO members
                     decided to rush to Nairobi to seek audience with John Serut, their member of
                     parliament. The reception they received was a frosty one no doubt because Mr.
                     Serut may well have already been in the process of committing to the 50 – 50
                     split of Chebyuk:
                           We organized a delegation and visited him in Nairobi. When we got there, he dodged us.
                           He gave us audience to only one old man called “Saso Laibon” and an elder by the name
                           “Jason Manyuya Sanguywa”. 61

             70.	    Defeated and desperate, the CBO members then remembered their ‘son’ in Nairobi,
                     Fred Kapondi. They claimed to have spoken to him informally and to have received
                     astonishing advice regarding the upcoming survey:
                           We approached Hon. Fred Chesebe Kapondi. Although Hon. Kapondi was not a member
                           of parliament at the time, he was an active politician whom we recognized. So we talked
                           to him several times. We talked to Hon. Kapondi, who was also in Nairobi. He was the
                           one who gave us the idea of coming up with war – that maybe we could fight our
                           neighbours, the Ndorobo.62

             71.	    There is no indication that Mr. Kapondi had any formal involvement with this
                     CBO during initial months. But given their profile and position in the community
                     as Soy elders, it is more than likely that Mr. Kapondi was well aware of them
                     and their activism. According to this witness, in 2005 – 2006, the CBO sensed
                     that their interests were being threatened by Mr. John Serut’s political about-
                     face and the adoption of the 50 per cent Soy and 50 per cent Mosop approach to
                     Chepyuk III was looking more and more likely. At this point, the witness claimed,
                     the members of the CBO approached Mr. Kapondi for advice and assistance. Mr.
                     Kapondi is then supposed to have told them to ‘take up arms’ and to defend their
                     lands.63

62           REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION
                                                                                          Vol u m e III   Chapter TWO




72.	     Mr. Kapondi’s rejection of these claims was vehement. He has completely denied
         any such contact and interactions with the CBO. His stand is that the claims
         were in essence fabricated as part of his sham trial and that CBO members have
         subsequently apologized for what they said:
             Commissioner: Are you familiar with an organization allied to Chepkurur and
             Korng’otuny Community Based Organization?
             Hon. Fred Kapondi Chesebe: That came in during my (trial?). Some of the witnesses
             who were giving evidence against me, who later came to me and apologized after I was
             elected member of Parliament, were part of this. What you are telling me was part of the
             statement by the witnesses against me. They later apologized to me.64

73.	     In further testimony, Kapondi reiterated that the CBO witnesses had been untruthful
         and had confessed to the fallacy of their statements about him:
             What they told me was: “Mheshimiwa, these things were set up. We came to testify but
             there was nothing we knew. We are sorry that we put you into the situation that you
             are in.”65

74.	     The General Election of 2013 saw yet another shift in Mount Elgon’s political
         landscape. Running as an independent candidate, Mr. Serut defeated Mr. Kapondi
         to reoccupy the seat he had relinquished in 2007.


April 2006: A Call to Arms
75.	     April 2006 was a tense and difficult month in Mount Elgon. Much to the disgust of
         many Soy claimants, Chepyuk Phase Three had to be shared between them and the
         Mosop. Plots were capped at just two hectares. The grim news was confirmed when
         the list of beneficiaries was published and posted in the District Commissioner’s
         office. The lucky ones were to await their letters of allocation. The unlucky ones
         faced a much less rosy future; dispossession and eviction was their fate. Those most
         bitter about these developments were a core group of very large land owners who
         had somehow over many years managed to avoid the Chebyuk dragnet. This time
         round however, things seemed quite different. Redistribution and eviction looked
         inevitable.

76.	     The Commission received testimony about a day in early April when, it seems,
         the decision was made to reject and protest the terms of Chebyuk Phase Three.
         A Mount Elgon resident was summoned to the home of Patrick Komon. Komon

Volume III   Chapter TWO




                       formed part of this coterie of large land owners. He was also Wycliffe Matakwei’s
                       father. Matakwei was the previously unremarkable and fairly average young man
                       who became the commander of SLDF. Komon’s home was hosting a meeting:
                           It was noon and the clock was ticking towards 1.00 p.m. I saw the son of Patrick Komon.
                           He came to my home and told me: “There is a meeting at our place and my old man
                           needs you.” So I just accompanied him to their home. When I reached Mzee Patrick
                           Komon’s place, he welcomed me.66

             77.	      A meeting was underway as the witness arrived at and entered the Komon home:
                           When I arrived, I found that there was a meeting which was going on. The people I
                           found there were known to me. I saw one of the sons of Patrick Komon, whose name
                           was Matakwei. He was the chairperson of that meeting. In that meeting, I found people
                           whom I could identify. I saw Patrick Komon. There was Hon. Fred Chesebe Kapondi.
                           The others were Jacob Sawos, Benson Chesikak and Nathan Warsama.67

             78.	      The witness claimed that a Miss Komon, Mr. Maling’a and Titus Waikei were also
                       present. Attendees were said to be holding discussions about what to do about
                       next about the situation in Chebyuk. A solution was proposed:
                           Leader of Evidence: What did you hear them discuss or what did you see them do?
                           Witness: When Matakwei asked what we were supposed to do, Hon. Kapondi said that
                           we had to protest about this, and that the only way to protest was by fighting so that
                           our land could not be given to the other people. He said: “You must fight so that the
                           Government can realize that your land should not be taken away from you. Then, finally
                           you will be given your land.68

             79.	      Further allegations were made surrounding guns that were to be used in the fight
                       for the land:
                           By the end of the meeting, many people had come and said that they would protest
                           against the subdivision that was going on. Kapondi then said: “It is better if people had
                           guns, so that you can protest and buy more guns.” Then seven people came forward
                           and said that they already had guns. The first person who said so was Nathan Warsama.
                           We had Patrick Komon, who produced his gun. Baraza Ayub also produced his gun and
                           Titus Weikei also produced his gun. So these people, produced guns, which amounted
                           to eight guns.69

             67	 Nathan Warsama was a well known local politician in Mount Elgon. He stood and was elected unopposed as the councilor for Sasur

64           REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION
                                                                                                                       Vol u m e III    Chapter TWO




80.	     Soon afterwards, a second meeting was held at Warsama’s residence. The witness
         did not give details. Those present, however, were described as undergoing an
         important ritual designed to bind them to each other and to their newfound cause.
         The ritual was overseen by Psongwoyo Manyiror, the Soy laibon who was also one
         of the largest land owners in Chebyuk:
              After the guns were produced during the second meeting, Mzee Jason Psongwoyo said:
              “Bring one sheep outside.” So, a male sheep was taken out and slaughtered. The dung
              was squeezed out of the intestines, which they used to smear the guns as they talked in
              tongues.

81.	     The Commission did not receive any additional evidence from any other witnesses
         on these two key meetings which supposedly took place in April 2006. There
         was no way for the Commission to verify what the witness saw and heard. Like
         Mr. Kapondi, Mr. Manyiror was arrested for promoting warlike activities and
         subsequently released.70 The charges did not stick. And yet both men feature so
         prominently in narratives about the origin and emergence of the SLDF. It has made
         for a complex tableau of claims and counter-claims.
              What the Commission can be certain about is that the publishing of the Chebyuk Phase
              III list in April 2006 marked a point of no return. Once that list was made public, there
              was no going back to a kinder, gentler time when differences might have been civilly
              discussed. As one witness put it, the list was an indication that ‘blood would now flow’
              on Mount Elgon.71



The Onset of Violence
82.	     In August 2006, an assistant chief, Shem Cherowo Chemuny, who had been
         ‘implicated in bribery to influence land allocation’ was killed along with two guards
         and his daughter.72This murder was followed by that of Cleophas Sonit, the chief
         of Kapkateny Location, who was related to [former MP] Serut and had refused
         to comply with SLDF demands. He was killed in his office in June 2006.73 Ben
         Kipnusu, a councillor of Chepkube ward and a Serut supporter, was then murdered
         in January 2007.74Mr. Serut had complained to the police and high government
         structures on numerous occasions that his relatives were targeted by the SLDF and
         that no action was taken in response.75

             83.	     As has been explained above, the original and ostensible purpose of the protection
                      of the Soy clan’s land interests in Chebyuk Phase Three. Wycliffe Kirui Matakwei
                      volunteered with other young men, mostly from the Soy tribe to take up arms
                      against the evictions. Young people were mobilized by the community to defend
                      them against the evictions:
                           The worst eviction was that of 2006. Most of these boys just went to the forest and
                           formed the militia.76

             84.	     This group formed the fighting wing of the SLDF.77 They initially called themselves
                      Janja weed but later changed to SLDF, as that name was more telling of the nature
                      of their fight78. Initially, the group engaged in fairly low-scale skirmishes, mainly
                      targeting the Mosop.79 Full scale violence erupted after the publication of the final
                      list of plot allocation for Chepyuk III in March 2006.

             85.	     With time, the militia’s ambitions changed somewhat with new rhetoric expanding to
                      include taking back land not just in Mt. Elgon, but also those stretches of Trans-Nzoia
                      which were forcefully taken from the community by the colonialists.80 The expanded
                      land interests echoed claims placed by the Sabaot before the Carter Commission
                      in 1932. The SLDF concentrated its activities in Kopsiro division where Chepyuk
                      settlement scheme is located and in Cheptais where most of the SLDF commanders
                      (including Matakwei) and majority of land claimants in Chepyuk III originally came
                      from.81

             86.	     The militia became involved in a variety of human rights abuses, including
                      rape, torture, murder, abductions, and assaults. In February 2007, Matakwei had
                      threatened that the SLDF would attack neighbouring areas if the government
                      did not move swiftly to resettle squatters.82 As one witness told the Commission:
                           In 2007/2008 during the past elections, the SLDF came into Kimama and picked out
                           people. There is a family that had all its members killed.83

Membership, Leadership and Oath
87.	     The most prominent and widely-known member of the SLDF was Wycliffe Kirui
         Matakwei84, the son of community elder Patrick Komon.85 The militia included “within
         its ranks former army and police officers, such as David Sichei, who had been attached
         to the elite presidential security unit during President Moi’s administration and has
         been named by witnesses as the current leader of the militia. Sichei was reportedly
         responsible for military training for SLDF militiamen.”86 Matakwei was killed in May
         2008 in an operation carried out by the Kenyan army which apparently crushed the
         militia.87

88.	     SLDF consisted of three distinct branches.88 The first was a military wing headed by
         Matakwei. The second was a spiritual wing led by the Laibon (or spiritual leader),
         Jason Psongoywo Tirop, an 80-year old Soy. Psongoywo had the respect of locals
         and administered oaths89. Psongoywo denies any involvement with the SLDF90. The
         third was a political wing. This wing was the most difficult to pinpoint, and was also
         believed to be the source sustaining SLDF intellectually and financially. John Kanai
         acted as ‘its self-proclaimed spokesman’ but ‘many politicians have been linked to
         the militia’.91

89.	 Research emphasizes the prominent role that laibons—spiritual and ritual
     experts-- have played in war throughout the history of the Sabaot and other
     Kalenjin-speaking peoples.92 They are believed to possess extraordinary powers,
     though their influence has diminished in recent decades.93 SLDF was no exception.
     Members of the militia took an oath of spiritual guidance administered by Jason
     Psongoywo the powerful and long-serving laibon who testified before the
     Commission. Mr. Psongoywo himself is somewhat reticent on his administration
     of the oath. Secondary literature has described him as being responsible for giving

                      enemy bullets during combat, making them invincible.’94 It has been speculated
                      that belief in invincibility might explain why the group often informed its targets
                      before strikes and also why it continued to gain young recruits despite prosecution
                      by the state.95

             90.	     Most SLDF combatants seem to have operated from their own homes convening
                      only when they had a specific operation to conduct. Upon completion of a particular
                      mission, they melted back into the community which made it very difficult for
                      security agents to track them down.96 Only the leaders had defined bases of
                      operation, ‘such as caves on the forested mountain slopes’.97 The combatants
                      typically ‘organized themselves in small groups of 10 to 12 people that made their
                      movements difficult to detect’.98

             91.	     The SLDF was initially led by a single command structure but as the number
                      of members grew bigger, it was subdivided into four camps each led by a
                      commander.99 Philip Tirot was the overall commander.100 The Commission also
                      received information that the SLDF established their own “courts” to judge and
                      administer punishment of local area residents who failed to support the militia.
                      One witness told the Commission of being taken before those courts several times;
                      on one occasion, the court was presided by Matakwei himself.101

             92.	     Membership in the group consisted mostly of boys and young men. Some of them
                      were taken out schools.102 Others were abducted from their homes.103 A number
                      joined voluntarily, as they were told to defend their community.104 Politicians
                      were said to have supported the group and were involved in the political wing.
                      Witnesses have told the Commission of a strong personal link between Wycliffe
                      Matakwei and Fred Kapondi Chasebe. Several meetings have been reported to
                      take place between Mr. Kapondi and important constituents of SLDF including
                      initial founding meetings.105In subsequent meetings in 2005, planning allegedly
                      took place for the murder of several people.106

                            Sammy Cherobe who was injured on the arm during the clashes.


95.	     Mr. Kapondi has also been described as using the SLDF to facilitate his election
         in 2007 through intimidation of opponents and voters. As one witness put it,
         ‘whoever opposed Kapondi would be killed or his house would be destroyed.’107 The
         Commission received information on leaflets being distributed by SLDF on the eve
         of the election stating that any area that would register a high number of votes for
         PNU would be “dealt with”; an attack in which 18 people were killed in the Chesikaki
         area was allegedly in retaliation for voting for the ‘wrong’ candidate.108 The house of
         a candidate for the Mt.. Elgon seat, Mr. Sammy Chemwei, was set on fire by masked
         men armed with AK-47s, a hallmark of the SLDF. Mr. Chemwei told the Daily Nation
         that he had been attacked for refusing to step down for Kapondi.109

94.	     As described above, Kapondi was incarcerated for nine months in 2007 managing to
         win the ODM nomination and the election from behind bars. It was reported to the
         Commission that Kapondi was allowed to remain in contact with the SLDF command
         while in prison and that senior ODM politicians such as Mr. Raila Odinga and Mr.
         William Ruto visited him on occasion and also may have sent him money. A witness
         told the Commission that Mr. Kapondi ordered the assassination of some people--
         including some members of Mr. Serut’s family--by mobile phone.110 The Commission
         was not able to corroborate that information.

Volume III   Chapter TWO




             Financing and Connections with State Actors
             95.	     SLDF has received financing from politicians,111 but this financial assistance has
                      been limited in its source, as the group largely sustained itself through looting,
                      cattle rustling112 and demanding taxes, food, and protection fees from local
                      residents.113 The SLDF also created a taxation system for teachers.114

             96.	     The Commission received information linking high ranking ODM party officials to
                      Wycliffe Matakwei.115 There are allegations that John Bomet Serut, provided a small
                      number of weapons to the SLDF in the initial stages of the creation of the militia,116
                      although he denies it. Fred Chesebe Kapondi, was also involved in the creation of
                      the militia, although he also denies it.117

             97.	     Mr. John Serut has also been linked to Moorland Defense Force and the Political
                      Revenge Force, militias that were apparently established to respond to protect
                      the Mosop and Serut’s supporters respective against the SLDF onslaught and
                      launch offensives against the SLDF.118 Mr. Serut is meant to have been close to
                      members of the Sangulas; the family of a prominent Mosop laibon who provided
                      spiritual inspiration and ritual protection for MDF fighters. The literature suggests
                      that neither of these two groups seems have had much of an impact and any
                      missions/operations that they launched were sporadic and limited in scope. Also,
                      the witnesses may have erred in associating Mr. Serut with the Political Revenge
                      Force. That was an entirely different group that did not feature in the Mount Elgon
                      conflict. In March 2008 police raided the Kwanza farm of Mr. David Nakitare, the
                      former Member of Parliament for Sabaoti.119 Two hundred young men calling
                      themselves the Political Revenge Force were found training on the premises and a
                      warrant was issued for Mr. Nakitare’s arrest.

             98.	 Serut has also been accused of trying to assassinate Kapondi and to have
                  contributed, with the help of the Criminal Investigations Department (CID),120 of
                  fabricating charges for his arrest, in order to keep him out of the 2007 election
                  campaign.121 Serut is reported acknowledging in public to have organised the
                  killing of one of Kapondi’s close collaborators, Absalom.122

99.	     The Commission received allegations of high ranking ODM officials123 facilitating
         the purchase of food and a small number of weapons.124 One witness told the
         Commission that an ODM official supported the SLDF as an instrument to attack
         political (PNU) opponents but that the support of ODM was gradually removed as
         the militia became more violent and unruly, and started killing civilians unrelated
         to the political fight.125

100.	 Witnesses have also testified before the Commission on links between SLDF and
      the police. In several cases, informants have been killed after providing intelligence
      on SLDF, especially to the (Criminal Investigations Department)CID.126


State Responses
101.	 As has been explained above, the descent into violence in Mount Elgon started in
      March and April of 2006 when the final list of Chepyuk Phase Three beneficiaries was
      published and posted at the District Commissioner’s headquarters in Kapsakwony.
      Prior to this there had been isolated skirmishes and incidents. In June 2006 the
      SLDF announced itself with the splashy violent and brutal killing of a chief and
      assistant chief in the area. Mount Elgon then descended into the orgy of violence
      that the Commission has heard so much about in evidence and testimonies.

102.	 The security apparatus in Mount Elgon was very slow in getting to grips with the
      problem posed by the SLDF. The early characterization of the SLDF fighters as
      uneducated local thugs, hooligans and common criminals went some way to
      convincing the Kenya Government that the militia was first and foremost a security
      issue that could fairly easily be handled with the deployment of the regular police,
      administration police, general service unit officers and anti-stock theft officers. The
      Rapid Deployment Unit of the Administration Police unit was particularly prominent
      in these early operations.127 These missions had limited and mixed results.

103.	 Prior to the inclusion of military personnel in the area in 2008, the police and the
      paramilitary police, the General Service Unit (GSU), launched several unsuccessful
      low-level security operations in Mt. Elgon targeting the SLDF forces.128 These
      missions, however, were also riddled with allegations of human rights abuses,
      including beatings, looting and burning of houses and food granaries, raping of

                       women and girls, indiscriminate arrests, extortion, and killings at the hands of the
                       police.129 There was a further spike in the Mount Elgon violence following the
                       2007 General Election. It was at this point that a decision was made to adopt
                       the more militarily aggressive approach of Okoa Maisha.


             Operation Okoa Maisha: Saving Lives?
             104.	 In March 2008, the army moved into Mount Elgon. Kapkota, which lies a few kilometers
                   north of Cheptais, became the main base; smaller bases were set up elsewhere on
                   the mountain. The military continues to maintain a presence in Kapkota.

             105.	 The military personnel identified were drawn mainly from two units: the elite 20
                   Parachute Battalion130 and 1 Kenya Rifles Battalion131. The Kenyan General Service
                   Unit (GSU) and regular police officers offered support. The end result was a mission
                   that has been described as an ‘extremely heavy handed’.132 In an attempt to flush out
                   hiding SLDF members and hidden illicit weapons, the joint coalition of military, GSU,
                   and police visited every village in the Mt. Elgon area, rounding up thousands of men
                   and boys aged from ten and above.133 It is alleged that the joint forces then tortured
                   and unlawfully detained the Mt. Elgon residents, and there are also reports that an
                   undetermined number were killed or disappeared.

             106.	 Despite the reports that human rights abuses had occurred, the government
                   largely considered the operation a success in subduing SLDF. The Ministry of State
                   for Defence stated that when the operation ended, large quantities of weapons
                   had been recovered, the leaders and members of SLDF had been identified and
                   arrested, and that the people of Mt. Elgon ‘were appreciative of the efforts made by
                   the Army to rid them of the menace of SLDF that had dogged them for so long.’134

             130	 20 Parachute Battalion is the only commando unit in the Kenya Army that is trained in counter-terrorism tactics by both the United
                  States and the UK-based “Operation Monogram.” Operation Monogram” provides counter-terrorism training and equipment to
                  foreign security forces in parts of the world that the British Government sees as threatening or breeding extremism. Because of its
                  shared border with war-torn Somalia and its own experiences with terrorist attacks, particularly the US embassy bombing in 1998,
                  Kenya was one of the first beneficiaries of this program. After the allegations of human rights abuses at Mt.. Elgon came to light,
                  Human Rights Watch specifically called on the British Government to stop training Kenyan security forces. Ben Rawlence, Trained

             131	 There are conflicting reports with regard to the exact number of troops deployed on the mission. While the District Security and
                  Intelligence Committee (DSIC) stated that the mission was composed of about 400 security force members, including 120 from
                  the 20 Para Battalion, the Chief of General Staff and the Assistant Minister for Defence stated that they deployed approximately

Military Accountability
107.	 Although government spokespeople have referred to Okoa Maisha Operation as a
      ‘joint police-military operation’—a term which has encouraged both the military
      and the police to attribute fault to one another—recent reports and interviews
      suggest that the military was in control of the operation.

108.	 In investigating the logistics of the operation and the chain of command, the
      Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions questioned
      various Kenyan officials during a country visit in 2009. The Mt. Elgon District
      Security Intelligence Committee (DSIC) informed him that the operation was
      directed by the Western Province Provincial Police Officer, and that he directed
      both the police and the military.135 They said that the police were responsible
      for arrests and interrogations, and that the military involvement was limited to
      providing vehicles to transport suspects and helping cordon areas in which the
      police carried out arrests.136

109.	 Although the DSIC’s account, as well as that of the government, portrays the army’s
      role to primarily provide security to police units conducting search operations,
      witnesses and victims interviewed about the human rights abuses confirmed
      that those who passed through Kapkota were arrested by men in military uniform
      and transported in military trucks to Kapkota where soldiers were responsible for
      beatings and interrogations. Those interviewed specifically used the word “jeshi,”
      which is the Swahili word meaning army soldier, as opposed to “askari” meaning
      an armed guard.137 Victims and witnesses also described the men who arrested
      them as dressed in full military fatigue, wearing the black and navy berets of
      the army rather than the red berets of the GSU.138

110.	 The Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial killings was also provided with credible
      information from citizen informants who worked directly with the military
      that members of the army were involved in abuses at the search stage of the
      operation.139An intelligence officer working with the military at the camps also
      described a very different chain of command from that detailed by the Kenyan
      Government in an interview with Human Rights Watch. The intelligence officer
      said that while many police were present at the camp in Kapkota, they were all
      dressed in military uniforms and taking orders from the military commander.
      He described the military as “firmly in control” of operations at Kapkota and

                      Mwasserah, it was always the military commander that acted as the effective head
                      of the operation on the ground.140 Finally, the army had control over the everyday
                      operations of the mission as “the one in charge of combat operations, and the
                      principle supplier of logistics in terms of trucks, jeeps, arms, and helicopters.”141

             111.	 In consideration of these reports and interviews, it is clear that the military
                   was in operational command over the purportedly “joint” mission. This chain of
                   command suggests that not only did the commander of the military, Col. Boiwo,
                   know what was taking place during the round-up in the villages and later at
                   the camps, but he also played an active role in allocating orders that led to the
                   alleged human rights abuses.

                                                                                                                     Vol u m e III    Chapter TWO




Human Rights Violations and Operation Okoa
Maisha
113.	 In recent years, numerous human rights organizations have reported on Operation
      Okoa Maisha. The reports and interviews conducted by Médecins Sans Frontières,
      Human Rights Watch, Independent Medico-Legal Unit, the Kenya National
      Commission on Human Rights, Mwatikho Torture Survivors Organisation, and
      Western Kenyan Human Rights Watch all reveal similar human rights violations that
      occurred during the initial round-up, at the military camps, and in the aftermath of
      the operation.

114.	 Commission’s hearings and statements received from residents of Mt.. Elgon region
      confirmed most of the findings of these reports. Other chapters of this Report
      record the nature and extent of such violations in detail.


Silences
115.	 Operation Okoa Maisha has been placed behind a wall of silence. The Commission’s
      interactions with military were difficult; requests for reports, documentation and
      appointments went largely unanswered. Part of the problem, the Commission
      believes is found in the profile of the lead Kenya Army Battalion involved in Okoa
      Maisha. The 20th Parachute Battalion is, by some distance, the best trained and
      supported unit of the Kenya Army. As has been mentioned above, 20th Para has
      for the past decade been the focus of British, American and Israeli efforts to
      improve the ability of the Kenya military to respond to terrorist activity.

116.	 The importance and the centrality of 20th Para to the Kenya Army and the Kenya
      Government made it difficult to fully expose the Battalion’s activities in Mount
      Elgon. Inquiry was further complicated by diplomatic interventions. On the 8th of
      August 2008, a diplomatic cable originating in London was sent out to a number
      of top-level intelligence organisations such as the CIA.142 The contents of this
      cable (subsequently made public through the Wikileaks) suggest that because
      of allegations made about 20th Parachute Battalion, the United Kingdom was
      reconsidering the battalion’s participation in Operation Donzel and Operation
      Monogram. The British considered a number of options. One suggestion was

Volume III   Chapter TWO




                       to include ‘human rights components’ in the training offered to the 20th Para.143
                       Another suggestion was to wait to see how the Kenyan courts handled the cases
                       filed by victims.

             117.	 Especially interesting is the Government’s reaction to the concerns raised about
                   20th Para’s behaviour and conduct in Mount Elgon. Kenyan authorities assured the
                   British—and this is critical—that 20th Parachute Battalion had not committed any
                   human rights violations during their pursuit of SLDF fighters. The government
                   blamed another unnamed unit based near 20th Para. The Kenyan Government
                   then assured the British that the military was addressing the problems. This
                   may have gone some way to leading the Kenya Desk at Operations Donzel
                   and Monogram to observe that there was no ‘concrete evidence’ behind the
                   allegations. The Commission has come to the conclusion that there have been
                   high level tactical and strategic attempts to shield 20th Parachute Battalion from
                   allegations of human rights violations.


             Impact
             118.	 It was difficult for community members to distinguish SLDF fighters from government
                   security agents because they deliberately wore very similar uniforms. This enabled
                   the group to invade homes, attack and harass individuals, and extort money and
                   property.144 Furthermore, because most SLDF combatants operated from their
                   own homes, they remained integrated in the community.145 This gave the militia a
                   certain intimacy and closeness with the people that they violated and preyed upon.
                   Residents were threatened and remained fearful of retribution if they revealed
                   information regarding the identity of combatants and activities of the group.146

             119.	 Over 600 individuals had died as a result of the conflict, and roughly 66,000 had
                   been displaced by 2008.147 Families have been separated and the education of
                   thousands of pupils disrupted.148 Furthermore, the economy suffered greatly
                   due to disruptions to the farming environment because of displacement. This
                   caused a negative impact on “food security, food prices, and nutrition in the
                   district and beyond.”149

120.	 The Commission has received many testimonies of victims of SLDF attacks.
      The violations committed included murders, torture and sexual abuse. Several
      witnesses also spoke of beheadings150, forced circumcisions151 and cutting of
      ears152. As one witness told the Commission:
             They came into the house, they took my husband away and slaughtered him outside.
             As they were slaughtering him, he was crying and yelling, then one person said my
             husband should pray since his last day had come. When he finished praying, they killed
             him and dumped him there.153

121.	 A witness testified as follows concerning the killing of her aunt by SLDF:
             It was on a Monday at 3:00 pm and I was sitting with my Auntie. About 15 men came.
             They started beating us and took us to Chebyuk Forest. They tied our hands behind us
             and beat us all the way to the forest. When we were about to reach the forest, they told
             me to sit down and made my Auntie lie down. They then slashed her.154

122.	 Another witness talked about how she was gang-raped by SLDF men in 2007 on
      her way to her house:
             We reached a place and then they started raping me. I can remember very well that
             they were four men. […] After finishing they woke me up. […] We went on. […] They
             put me down again and started raping me again. I was really injured and traumatised.

123.	 She was unconscious for some time. When she woke up, the men came back and
      tried to get her to stand and walk:
             When I fell down, another one came from nowhere and urinated on me. […] He forced
             me to swallow the urine. I swallowed it.155

124.	 She was later disowned by her husband on the perception that she had contracted
      HIV from the rapes. Another witness told the Commission that:
             On Sunday, 17th September 2006, in the evening, the SLDF came to my door and
             knocked. They entered and pointed guns at me. […] they beat my husband and
             children. They also beat me up. […] They slaughtered my son. They went with my
             husband and shot him six times at the back. They cut his head, his private parts and
             hands.156

                      shortage of teachers, as recounted to the Commission by a witness:
                           I buried eight teachers and 30 pupils. Many of my teachers were punished. Many of
                           them were given 200 canes. Sometimes, six inch nails would be used to sew up lips.
                           It made teachers to flee this land. Up to now they have not come back. The shortage
                           you are seeing is a result of that. Six schools were closed down and up to this time,
                           they are still closed.157

             128.	 Several witnesses have indicated to the Commission that individuals connected
                   with the SLDF and former SLDF fighters still represent a threat to security in
                   the Mt. Elgon area. For example, David Chemaimak Sichei has been reported
                   to be the current commander of the SLDF and is allegedly currently located in

         Uganda.158 Witnesses were concerned about questions of re-formation and re-
         emergence of the militia because of continued failure to capture and try men
         like Sichei.


Conclusion
127.	 The Mount Elgon conflict is at once unique and typical. For the Commission its
      uniqueness comes from the fact that the region is home to a very particular mix of
      ethnicities, historical and contemporary experiences that cannot be reproduced.
      It is this unique combination that in turn gave rise to the Sabaot Land Defence
      Force (SLDF). The militia and the state’s attempts to quash it are unprecedented.
      For all its uniqueness, however, Mount Elgon sits within an identifiable trend in
      modern Kenyan history: the inherent instability and disruptive potential of issues
      surrounding ethnicity, land and politics. The forces that eventually pulled Elgon
      are by no means limited to the mountain. They feature throughout the country
      and carry with them the capacity to manifest with similar violence and chaos.

                    Healing and Reconciliation

Introduction
1.	   Kenya’s history has been characterised by tragic episodes of gross violations
      of human rights. Most of these atrocities were committed between 1963 and
      2002 during which Kenya African National Union (KANU) was at the helm of
      power. KANU, the independence party, and under the leadership of President
      Jomo Kenyatta and later President Daniel Arap Moi, created an authoritarian,
      oppressive and corrupt state. It created a traumatised nation of thousands of
      individuals living with physical and psychological wounds in a country that had
      no time or space for their experiences and stories. Indeed, for decades, Kenya has
      remained a nation in which communities stand divided along ethnic and regional
      lines suspicious and distrustful of one another. Over the decades feelings of inter-
      communities distrust, even hatred, have festered mainly because a myriad of
      issues which are at the core of nation building have largely remained unresolved.
      These issues include land problems, inequality and regional imbalances, and
      impunity combined with a lack of transparency and accountability. These issues
      have eroded a sense of belonging, nationhood, and public trust in political and
      governance institutions.

2.	   Since independence, successive governments have employed silence, denial
      and selective amnesia whenever individuals and agencies have raised the need
      to address these fundamental issues. Painful memories of have being passed
      from one generation to another, and as a consequence, present generations
      continue to hold grudges for violations and historical injustices meted against




                                                                                             81
Volume III   Chapter THREE




                        their forefathers and mothers. Until now, the scale and impact of human rights
                        violations and historical injustices have neither been fully acknowledged nor
                        sufficiently addressed. This has in turn nurtured an atmosphere of latent tension,
                        hatred and suspicion among individuals and communities. This tension flared
                        up in December 2007 following the declaration of the results of the Presidential
                        Election. The outcome was an unprecedented tragedy in Kenya’s history: a
                        violent conflict in which an estimated 1,133 people died while approximately
                        650,000 were displaced from their homes and property worth billions of shillings
                        destroyed through arson and other forms of attacks.

             3.	        In the aftermath of the 2007/2008 Post Election Violence, the Truth, Justice and
                        Reconciliation Commission was established and mandated to ‘promote peace,
                        justice, national unity, healing and reconciliation among the people of Kenya’.1
                        Upon establishment, the question that starkly confronted the Commission was
                        this: how can healing, reconciliation and national unity be fostered so that all the
                        Kenyan people can be mobilized towards a common vision and future; a future
                        characterised by a shared national identity, and common values and aspirations
                        as captured in the words of the National Anthem? This Chapter is a synthesis of
                        the feelings of Kenyans concerning the critical issue of national unity, healing
                        and reconciliation.


             Mandate and Conceptual Issues
             4.	        The Commission mandate relating to the promotion of national unity, healing
                        and reconciliation was outlined in several provisions of the Truth, Justice and
                        Reconciliation Act (TJR Act). Firstly, the Commission was required under section
                        5(g) of the Act to ‘provide victims, perpetrators and the general public with a
                        platform for non-retributive truth telling’ in the hope that such a conversation
                        ‘would chart a new moral vision’ and ultimately lead to reconciliation. Secondly,
                        section 5(j) of the Act required the Commission to provide ‘repentant perpetrators
                        or participants in gross human rights violations with a forum to confess their
                        actions as a way of bringing reconciliation’. Further, the Commission was mandated
                        under section 6(s) of the TJR Act to ‘inquire into the causes of ethnic tensions
                        and to make recommendations on the promotion of healing, reconciliation and
                        coexistence among ethnic communities’. Finally, under Section 6(j) of the Act,
                        the Commission was mandated to ‘investigate any other matter that it considers
                        requires investigation in order to promote and achieve national reconciliation’.

82           REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION
                                                                                                Vol u m e III   Chapter THREE




5.	       In the course of its work, two competing interpretations regarding the Commission’s
          reconciliation work emerged. There are those who expected the Commission
          to actually reconcile warring communities and individuals. In this regard, the
          success of the Commission’s work lied in the actual reconciliation between a
          perpetrator and a victim or between warring communities. Another view was that
          the Commission’s role was to promote and contribute to reconciliation. In other
          words, the Commission’s processes were seen as a platform for beginning the
          process of reconciliation between individuals and communities. The Commission
          inclined towards the second view. Although it was and is desirable to see actual
          reconciliation between individuals and communities, the Commission recognised
          that meaningful reconciliation is not an event, but rather a long process and that
          the decision to reconcile is a personal decision, aimed at setting the stage and
          establishing the basis for the beginning of a reconciliation process. Accordingly,
          the Commission worked towards ensuring that its activities in the course of its
          life and the result of its work would substantially contribute to the process of
          reconciliation.

6.	       In essence, reconciliation is a complex concept. As the South African Truth and
          Reconciliation Commission learnt in its work, reconciliation is not only a highly
          contested concept, but it also has no simple definition.2 As such, it was satisfied,
          justifiably so, with outlining the essential elements of reconciliation rather than
          defining the term. The elements it identified include that: reconciliation is both a
          goal and a process; it is experienced at different levels (intra-personal, inter-personal,
          community and national); and that reconciliation has linkages to redistribution in
          terms of material reconstruction and the restoration of dignity. Similarly, the Sierra
          Leone Truth and Reconciliation Commission conducted its reconciliation work on
          the premise that ‘there is no universal model of reconciliation that can apply to all
          countries’.3

7.	       The Commission took a similar approach which it spelt out in its Reconciliation
          Policy. The Commission understood reconciliation to be a process rather than an
          event. It is a process undertaken by individuals who have committed or suffered
          violations and as such can be intensely private and personal. It is also a process
          that can be encouraged and even undertaken at the community and national
          level. Thus, the Commission saw its role in relation to reconciliation as that of
          laying the foundation for a long-term process. This approach finds validity when
          one considers the products of the KNDR negotiations.

                                          REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION                      83
Volume III   Chapter THREE




               The late NCIC Vice-Chair, Ms. Mary Onyango addressing the Stakeholders Consultative Workshop in Naivasha



             8.	     The KNDR team wisely laid the foundation for the creation of two institutions to further
                     reconciliation: this temporary Commission and the permanent National Cohesion
                     and Integration Commission (NCIC). Entrusting reconciliation in a permanent
                     commission dedicated to national cohesion acknowledges that reconciliation is not
                     only a process, but a continuous process. Reconciliation, like freedom, democracy,
                     national unity and many other fundamental values to which modern Kenya aspires,
                     must always be nurtured and cared for. This Commission, therefore, does not claim
                     to have achieved reconciliation for the nation. Rather, the hope of the Commission
                     is that by uncovering the truth, providing a forum for individuals to share their
                     experiences and by providing some accountability, the Commission will have placed
                     the nation on a path to further reconciliation and national cohesion and unity.

             9.	     As discussed in detail in the Chapter on Interpretation of Mandate in Volume 1 of
                     this Report, the Commission acknowledged that truth, justice and reconciliation
                     are interconnected and interrelated. These three factors work towards mending
                     relationships. As was well explained to a witness by Commissioner Ronald Slye
                     during one of the Commission’s hearings:

                                                                                             Vol u m e III   Chapter THREE




               [y]our ultimate goal is peace, national unity and reconciliation. This Commission is
               dedicated to furthering the process of national unity and reconciliation. But it is so
               eloquently stated that in order to have reconciliation, one needs to have some form
               of justice. If her water bottle has been taken from her, it needs to be returned or some
               compensation or reparation needs to be provided, but, of course, in order to have justice,
               one needs to know the truth to understand what happened and why it happened, the
               context in which it happened and who was responsible for this happening.4




                                  Policy on Reconciliation
          WHEREAS, the objectives and mandate of the Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission
     (TJRC), are set out in sections 5 and 6 of the Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Act no 6 of 2008
     (TJR Act) respectively; and
         WHEREAS, section 5 of the TJRC Act identifies national unity, healing and reconciliation as
     two of the five objectives and goals to be pursued by the TJRC; and
        	 WHEREAS, section 6 of the TJRC Act grants the TJRC all powers necessary to fulfil its
     mandate; and
         WHEREAS, the TJRC is mandated specifically by section 6 (s) to inquire into the causes of
     ethnic tensions and make recommendations on the promotion of healing, reconciliation and
     co-existence among ethnic communities; and
          WHEREAS, TJRC is required to provide space to both victims and perpetrators of gross
     violations of human rights to tell their stories; and
         WHEREAS, section 42 read together with sections 2, 5(2), 6(2) empower the Commission to
     investigate, receive information and propose policies, measures and ways to the government by
     which identified victims of gross human rights violations can be redressed; and
         WHEREAS, the TJRC is required to create an accurate and complete historical record of
     gross violations of human rights;
          WHEREAS, the TJRC will make recommendations in relation to memorialisation;


          THE TJRC HEREBY DECLARES:

          1. 	 The limited peace and harmony, justice and unity among Kenyans are attributable in part
               to the gross violations of human rights including tortures, assassinations, detentions,
               marginalisation and other serious socio-economic violations suffered by sections of the
               Kenyan population.

          2. 	 Reconciliation, national unity and healing are critical components of the mandate and
               three of the five key goals of the work of the Commission. As suggested by the name of
               the Commission, reconciliation is one of three key tasks assigned to the TJRC.

                                          REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION                   85
Volume III   Chapter THREE




                    3. 	The objectives of reconciliation, national unity and healing are integrated in various
                        activities of the TJRC, including statement taking, hearings, community dialogues,
                        amnesty process and the final report. Therefore, the work of the Reconciliation
                        Committee cuts across several units, and committees.

                    4. 	 The TJRC understands reconciliation as a complex term that includes several relationships,
                         levels and actors. In the English language, ‘reconciliation’ can connote: understanding,
                         bringing together, reunion, compromise or squaring off. The various levels or ‘types’ of
                         reconciliation include: intra-personal reconciliation; inter-personal reconciliation; inter-
                         community reconciliation; and national reconciliation.

                             4.1.	 Intra-personal reconciliation refers to the situation where an individual arrives
                                   at an to accommodation with their situation and circumstances after the
                                   violation. For a victim, knowing the truth can bring closure, and in some cases,
                                   the understanding that they find themselves with a new situation that they have
                                   to cope with and move forward (e.g. disability brought about by a violation).
                             4.2. 	 Interpersonal reconciliation relates to reconciliation between specific victims
                                    and perpetrators. Knowing the truth about who did what, the whereabouts of
                                    bodies etc., can be a critical first step to reconciliation.
                             4.3.	 In a context where inter-ethnic rancour and disharmony triggered by the
                                   struggles for power, resources, identity etc., has underpinned or facilitated
                                   some gross violations of human rights, the mending of social relations is an
                                   important goal for the TJRC. Communities include ethnic, religious groups
                                   and other groups. The TJRC will facilitate dialogues and other activities that
                                   commence the process of inter-community reconciliation.
                             4.4.	 Healing is closely linked to reconciliation. The idea of healing invokes the idea
                                   of remedy, restoration, repair, mending. National healing will entail attending
                                   to and restoring social relations in communities and inter-ethnic relations.
                                   At a personal level, healing will take various dimensions, but begins with
                                   acknowledgement, restoration of dignity (reparations, apology).

                    5. 	Reconciliation is both a goal and a process. As a goal, it is a long term goal. The TJRC
                        should not be expected to reconcile Kenyans at the end of its term: it will initiate dialogue
                        and lay the groundwork, together with other relevant bodies (e.g., NCIC) for long term
                        processes of reconciliation. As a process, rather than an event, it will occur in various sites
                        and activities. It will involve numerous actors, and the TJRC is but one of these.

                    6. 	 Informed by comparative experience and our own context, the TJRC places emphasis on
                         the conceptual and practical links between reconciliation & national healing and justice,
                         which includes redistributive justice, retributive justice and reparative justice. The goal
                         of reconciliation at various levels will remain elusive unless those who have suffered
                         are restored and repaired; unless those who were excluded are included in meaningful
                         ways; and unless those in dire want as a result of marginalization are materially enabled
                         to move forward.




86           REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION
                                                                                            Vol u m e III   Chapter THREE




       7. 	 The TJRC recognises the complex relationship between reconciliation, national healing
            and truth. While closure for victims and the ability to address violations of the past and
            prevent repetition of gross violations begins with knowing the truth about past events,
            truth telling may open wounds in ways that slow or impede reconciliation and healing
            especially at a personal level. The TJRC will engage with this paradox constructively in
            various activities.

       8.	 The notion of truth is complex, and includes versions or types of truth: personal
           or narrative truth (personal versions of truth by witnesses, including victims and
           perpetrators); factual or forensic truth (the product of investigations, verification and
           corroboration); social truth (the product of dialogue, interaction, discussion and debate;
           and healing and restorative truth.

       9. 	To achieve the goal of reconciliation, the TJRC puts emphasis on facilitating and/or
           recommend the following things
          a. 	 Dialogues and spaces for exchanges by and around individuals, communities and
               institutions
          b. 	 Truth discovery through confessions and other means in order to establish an
               accurate and complete historical record
          c. 	 Public acknowledgement violations and responsibility coupled with contrition and
               apologies, by individuals but also institutional and national leaders
          d. 	 Forgiveness (inter-personal; inter-community; state-community; state-individuals)
          e. 	 Ensuring accountability of individuals and institutions through: reparations
               (including restitution, compensation, memorialisation); and prosecutions
          f. 	 Restoring dignity of victims, through public acknowledgement, reparations and
               prosecutions.
          g. 	 Institutional reforms



Reconciliation Activities
10.	   The Commission’s reconciliation activities were spearheaded, at the Commissioners’
       level, by the Reconciliation Committee established in terms of section 22 of the TJR
       Act, and at the Secretariat level, by the Department of Civic Education and Outreach.

11.	   In preparation for rolling out reconciliation activities and particularly to ensure the
       participation of relevant stakeholders in such activities, the Commission convened
       two meetings in March 2011. On 3 March 2011, the Commission held a Consultative
       Prayer Breakfast with religious leaders in Nairobi. This was followed a week later by
       a three-day Stakeholders Consultative Workshop in Naivasha.

12.	   In February 2012, the Commission hosted a Reconciliation Consultative Meeting
       which brought together various stakeholders including experts, governmental

Volume III   Chapter THREE




                    Participants attending a Reconciliation Consultative Meeting hosted by the Commission in Naivasha



                       bodies and civil society organizations working in the field of peacebuilding and
                       reconciliation. The outcome of this meeting was the establishment of a Reconciliation
                       Reference Group which worked together with the Commissioner in conducting its
                       reconciliation activities, especially the countrywide reconciliation forums.5

             13.	      The Commission also initiated working relations with both governmental and non-
                       governmental organisations including with the National Cohesion and Integration
                       Commission (NCIC) and the National Steering Committee on Peace Building and
                       Conflict Management (established within the auspices of the Ministry of State
                       for Provincial Administration and Internal Security). The Commission’s working
                       relationship with the NCIC resulted in the formation of a Joint Task force on National
                       Healing and Reconciliation composed of Commissioners and staff from the two
                       commissions. Unfortunately, activities which the Joint Taskforce had planned to
                       carry out never took off.
             5	   The members of the Reconciliation Reference Group were drawn from, inter alia, the following organizations and institutions: Nairobi
                  Peace Initiative –Africa; Change Agents for Peace International Initiative; COPTRE; Peacenet; Kenya Inter-religious Consortium;
                  Prophetic prayers Network; Bunge la Mwanainchi Human Rights Group; Kenya Correspondents Association; Kibera Women for

14.	   In 2011 and 2012, the Commission supported and participated in several reconciliation
       activities organized by other stakeholders.

Countrywide Reconciliation Forums
15.	   From 9 to 20 March 2012, the Commission held a total of 10 reconciliation forums
       around the country. The forums were held in Mombasa, Garissa, Isiolo, Machakos,
       Nyeri, Eldoret, Nakuru, Kakamega, Kisumu and Nairobi. The forums served as avenues
       to:

           	Listen  and understand the meaning of reconciliation for communities in
              different regions of the country;

           	Find  out specific issues in each region that bring about tension, hostility,
              hatred and conflict.

16.	   The forums also gave communities the opportunity to suggest specific options
       and solutions to problems and issues affecting them. They were able to share their
       dreams about the Kenya they want and to recommend ways of promoting healing
       and reconciliation in their regions and ultimately in the whole of Kenya.

Workshops on Trauma Healing and Strategy Formulation
17.	   Between December 2012 and March 2013, the Commission organized a series
       of workshops on trauma healing and strategy formulation. The workshops
       were held in Cheptais, Eldoret, Mombasa, Kilifi, and Kwale. The objectives of
       these workshops were to: assess levels of healing and reconciliation in selected
       communities; identify local actors who could then spearhead trauma healing and
       reconciliation; and explore local mechanisms for healing and reconciliation.


Healing and Truth Telling
18.	   The Commission provided victims, perpetrators and the general public with a
       platform for non-retributive truth telling. In all its activities, particularly during
       its public hearings, the Commission appealed to the general public not only to
       be at peace with their neighbours but also to work towards national unity and
       reconciliations. Various commissioners, as demonstrated below, made extensive
       remarks in this regard:
          What I am here to say as Mama has so eloquently said before is that, in order for
          people to start to think about reconciling, they need to know what happened. They
          need to know who did what and then they need some form of justice, some form

                             of reparation. So, all that I would like to humbly request here is that those of you
                             who are familiar with these conflicts and are familiar with individuals, maybe some
                             of whom are here in this room and were involved in that conflict, to reflect upon
                             where we are today and to reflect upon the need expressed here by many of you for
                             national unity and reconciliation and to take advantage of this Commission to come
                             forward to us, either publicly or privately, talk to us about what you saw, what you
                             experienced and what you did [...] Everybody needs to step up. Everybody needs to
                             take the risk. One takes risks easily for conflict; one also needs to take risks for peace
                             and so this is just a humble plea for those of you who are here. I know you are here
                             because you want peace, because you want national unity and because you want
                             reconciliation. We ask you to take advantage of this process and of this Commission
                             because if you do so, I can assure you that we will do everything within our power
                             and abilities to assist you to reach that goal.6

             19.	       For the vast majority of victims and witnesses, the oral testimony they gave before
                        the Commission marked the first time they had spoken publicly about their pain,
                        anger and suffering. Many of these individuals said that the Commission was
                        the first public agency to show concern for their situation. Calvin Okeyo Ogutu,
                        former army officer accused of taking part in the 1982 attempted coup stated:

                             For 30 years we have kept mum and some people have been telling our story.
                             This is the first time that we have been given an opportunity to say exactly what
                             happened, and especially those things that affected us.7
             20.	       Similar sentiments were shared by the family of the late J.M Kariuki. Anthony
                        Kariuki, while testifying on the effect the assassination of their father, JM Kariuki,
                        had on their family had the following to say:

                             But imagine for once we are finally being given a chance to address the public nearly
                             40 years of wrongs. How late can we learn that this one chance in the aforementioned
                             40 years for a family of the JM Kariuki to have a public sanction hearing.8

             21.	       For some of the victims, they had been approached by many previous commissions
                        but the Commission was the first to give them audience. While recounting the
                        horrific accounts of violations that they or their relatives or friends suffered, one of
                        the survivors of the Wagalla Massacre observed:
                             If you [the Commission] are taking statements, I have written ten statements before but
                             nobody did anything for me. This is the first time I have been told to talk openly about it
                             and I thank you very much for that.9

            Secondary victims of Wagalla massacre at NHIF auditorium for Wagalla massacre hearings.


22.	     The hearings also served as an opportunity for some of the victims to not only
         speak out about their experiences but also a chance to tell the younger generation,
         which were mostly unborn at the time of the violation, what the victims went
         though at the hand of government agencies. It was a chance to write/rewrite
         history. In his testimony, Mr. Samuel Nyang’au Nyanchiengo stated:
             I am very grateful because today I have been given a chance to speak the truth on
             how we were tortured in 1982. Most of you had not yet been born but it is good for
             you to know what happened.10

23.	     For other victims, it was an opportunity to relief their pains and shed off the social
         stigma that they had endured. As an example, Omar Qutara was arrested in 1982,
         detained, tortured and later sentenced to three years imprisonment for allegedly
         participating in the aborted army coup. For close to 30 years following his release
         from prison, he lived with the shame of being referred to as a ‘rebel’ or ‘fugitive’.
         His children also suffered stigma as their father was publicly accused of being

                     ‘baba yao ni msaliti’ (their father is a rebel). His eloquent and detailed testimony
                     before the Commission was the first time that he had publicly spoken about his
                     experience, and in conclusion, he was grateful for that opportunity. He said:
                          I can sleep today. I am a little relieved. That was the major problem. I wanted many
                          people to come here because many of them call us fugitives or rebels here in town. I am
                          sure they have heard it today with their own ears.11

             24.	    Not all of the victims who testified before the Commission experienced healing and
                     reconciliation. For some of those victims, their experiences were too painful and
                     grave that nothing, including narration and compensation, would make them feel
                     better. Following the Commission’s thematic workshop on the media, for instance,
                     a survivor of the Mwakenya crackdown questioned not only ‘the rationale of us as
                     a nation re-living these horrors’ but also ‘the whole meaning’ of the Commission.
                     Another victim told the Commission that:
                          When I think about those issues, I feel so bad. I do not see the reason why we should talk
                          over such issues, because it will not help me. I do not have any children. One of my ears
                          cannot hear. I do not have any property. My son, who was a man, died because there
                          was nobody who could take care of him when he was sick. I failed to get another person,
                          who is a man, who will now inherit my wealth. Even if I talk from here, I do not know
                          whether the Government that can really help somebody. What is the importance of all
                          these discussions as we sit here?12

             25.	    In most forums, it is the adult victims that usually got an opportunity to narrate
                     their experiences. Some of them had suffered violations during their childhood and
                     had carried painful memories into their adulthood. For instance, June Ndambuki,
                     whose father was tortured and detained on allegation of his involvement in the
                     1982 attempted coup, narrated her struggles to come to terms with the torture,
                     detention and dismissal from active service of his father. She had the following to
                     say in relation to the subject of reconciliation:
                          We lost a lot of opportunities as children because my Dad had to balance to take care
                          of us and to take us to school. Of course, he wanted us to go to the best schools in the
                          nation but that was not possible because he went from one job to another, at one point,
                          he had to start a business, which did not take off because he was not prepared for it. Just
                          like the Swahili people would say: “Maji yakimwagika, hayazoleki or spilt milk can never be
                          recovered.” We cannot recover! Even if we asked for compensation as children, we cannot
                          be compensated for the opportunities we lost. I am sure reconciliation can be reached,
                          but who is to blame? Can they come into public and apologize and even explain to us why
                          all these happened? [...] I believe reconciliation is a process. Can we start somewhere by
                          understanding who is to blame and then move forward to the next level?13

92           REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION
                                                                                            Vol u m e III   Chapter THREE




Reconciliation and Forgiveness
26.	     The process of truth telling is critical in the search for healing and reconciliation. As
         the individual narrative is shared collectively, a gradual process of re-humanizing
         the victim (and offender) begins. Therefore, a critical starting point is understanding
         the perspectives of victims on the subject of reconciliation.

27.	     As indicated elsewhere in this Chapter, the Commission presented the victims of
         violations with an opportunity to narrate their experiences. Most of those victims
         also used the opportunity to state what they felt about the people behind their
         suffering. While some of the victims were ready to forgive, absolutely or with
         some conditions attached, the persons alleged to have been responsible for their
         suffering, others categorically expressed resentment and unwillingness to forgive.
         For the latter group of victims, not even the thought of reparation would make
         them change their mind.

Perspectives of victims
28.	     The Commission encountered individuals with a remarkable willingness to forgive
         the people responsible for their suffering. The Commission learnt that the victims
         desire to forgive was influenced by various factors key among them being: the
         victims’ religious beliefs that called upon them to forgive those who wronged them;
         lapse of time since the violations took place with some of the victims healing as the
         years went by; as well as a sense of helplessness and the sheer desire to ‘move on.’

29.	     Fundamentally because of their faith, some victims were willing to forgive and to
         co-exist with those who had wronged them. Indeed, some stated that they would
         not wish their perpetrators to go through what they went through. Such were the
         sentiments of Pastor Peterkins James Ogola, who, when testifying about the killing
         of his nephew by a named police officer, stated as follows:
             Allow me to state one thing that it is important as a family to team up with the TJRC in
             forgiving and in reconciling with the perpetrator. It is not the wish that the perpetrator
             should pass through the pain that we have passed through. So, let Mr. Njogu and his
             employer know very well that the family’s heart is open to forgive. We are ready to sit
             and reconcile because you never know what life has in store for him and for us. You never
             know the son of Njogu might become a DC or a prominent person in this place and we will
             meet with him. This is the main purpose of reconciliation. Friendship comes from out of
             the pain. So, let the family of Njogu be encouraged. If they are ready to receive this token
             and the employer which is the Government of Kenya and come out and face our family
             we are very ready. Please, give that information to the parties concerned. God bless you. 14

Volume III   Chapter THREE




             30.	     When asked whether he would like to meet the police officer who had shot his
                      nephew dead, Pastor Peterkins Ogola responded:
                          Of course, I would like even to see how he looks like, even shake his hand and
                          even say something in his language, but it will also take the hand of God for me
                          to bring him together with the young little widow and my eldest brother, who is
                          the father. It is going to be a process but I will be very glad if you make that effort
                          to bring us together. Let also the employer come out and tell us why he is hiding
                          Njogu. Thank you.15

             31.	     The same was the feeling of Gregory Onyuro, who, when asked what he would tell
                      the police officer who shot and left him paralysed, he stated:
                          I am a Christian and I am a person who understands. I can only ask for forgiveness
                          but if I can know the person, I want to tell him that if he is shot like he did for me,
                          how could he feel? I forgive him.16

             32.	     There were instances where even the victims showed sympathy for their perpetrators
                      acknowledging that they too were victims of a bad system. While testifying about the
                      torture he went through at the Nyayo Chambers, Mr. Wafula Buke stated the following
                      on a question whether he thought his torturers enjoyed doing it:
                          When I was free to move around, I think I was an angry man with the torturers. I remember
                          going to the reception of Nyati House and camping there to identify those who beat
                          me. I stuck there from 8.00 a.m. to 1.00 p.m. and saw three. One I now know is called
                          Wachira and he is my friend. That was the most violent. I also saw Opiyo who I think had
                          retired. He did not look like money. I also saw another one whom I do not know. But I
                          can say that in retrospect, I think we were all just in trouble. I remember when I was in
                          Nyayo House I had just been beaten up there. So, when I came out, I was locked in the
                          cell. I knocked to be taken to the toilets and when that fellow came, the guy asked me:
                          “Why did you not do it earlier?” He gave me a hard blow and I fell down. Later on, when I
                          reported him up to the wazees (elders), I think they talked to him. He told me: “I am sorry.
                          You know these old men are stressing us. They are giving us a lot of problems and so,
                          we are also just frustrated. So, I want to apologize.” It is from him that I got information
                          that students had rioted. I did not even know. I think the chain goes up to the torturers.
                          They also must have had their problems; being pushed to beat other people’s beautiful
                          children. I think the people who take the ultimate responsibility and may have some
                          enjoyment out of it are those who make lots of money and control power. Those are the
                          only people who enjoy. But I think having lived through that experience I can say that
                          Kenya was just a country of people suffering in various capacities. If you were in charge
                          of agriculture, you had your problems. You were delivering qualitatively you were just
                          like a police officer who was also delivering bad services. A medical officer was not any
                          better. He was just a perpetrator like any other. So, my outlook these days is that I think
                          we were victims of a system and that system needs to be dismantled.17

                                               Torture Chambers




33.	   While some of the victims talked of absolute forgiveness, others indicated their
       willingness to forgive subject to some conditions being met by the perpetrators as
       well as the government. These conditions ranged from the demand for the alleged
       perpetrators to confess their action and acknowledge their wrong doing, a demand
       for justice where perpetrators paid for their wrong, a demand for compensation; a
       demand for the alleged perpetrators to sincerely seek forgiveness on their own behalf;
       to a demand of meeting with the alleged perpetrators and having a conversation. For
       some of the victims, meeting of one demand was enough while others wanted more
       than conditions met by the alleged perpetrators as a prerequisite for forgiveness and
       reconciliation.

34.	   Ms. Nyarinda Moikobu’s testimony is a clear indication of the conditions that some of
       the victims attached to forgiveness and ultimately reconciliation. While testifying on
       how her property had, on many occasions that coincides with the general elections,
       been looted, Ms. Nyarinda Moikobu stated as follows:
           In conclusion, I would want to say that while people are going round asking for
           forgiveness, justice and reconciliation, if at all somebody is coming to say that “Nyarinda,
           I apologise”, he or she must confess what he did before I forgive him. If they tell me that
           they took my property, I am ready to forgive them. We are very ready to forgive but we

                          do not want blanket forgiveness and reconciliation. Why are you asking for forgiveness?
                          What have you done? Come out and say what you did, that is when we can see how we
                          can forgive each other.18

             35.	     While some of the victims were categorical that the individual perpetrators should
                      seek forgiveness or offer an apology, others like Mr. Gregory Onyuro, extended the
                      demand for an apology to the government and various government departments,
                      for their inability to protect the victims from violations when the same occurred.
                          There should be proper civic education conducted to all our communities so that
                          they understand issues. Secondly, parliamentarians should sit down and apologize to
                          Kenyans. Thirdly, we need to look for a donor who will empower the youth and all those
                          who were affected during the violence [...] We would like the President and the Prime
                          Minister to come to Nyanza Province and talk to the IDPs in this region. They need to tell
                          us that they are in power because of us. They need to apologize to us. This is because
                          they are earning while we are suffering. Look at me here. I urinate here. I smell urine just
                          because of post-election violence and I cannot perform sexually because of the post-
                          election violence. How do you think my family feels? My children cannot go to school.
                          They will now turn into thieves because I cannot help them. Women are becoming
                          prostitutes! I want the President to come to Nyanza Province and apologize because my
                          vote made him to be the President!19

             36.	     This was also the case for Maj. (Rtd.) Maxwell Kivihya, a former Kenya Air Force
                      Officer, who suffered for his alleged involvement in the 1982 attempted coup. In
                      his testimony, below, he mentioned a list of government officials, including the
                      former President Moi that he felt ought to apologize.
                          We would also pray that the Government publicly apologizes to these victims and all
                          the others in Kenya. That, perhaps, might improve our morale. President Moi, General
                          Mulinge and General Kariuki knew about this as expressed by Lieutenant Mwambura.
                          We pray that these officers should be investigated by the International Criminal Court,
                          so that we can get some justice because to date, we have got none. General Mulinge
                          and General Kariuki had prior knowledge of this attempted coup d’etat and they did
                          not institute measures to prevent it. General Kariuki confessed it in my presence and
                          discouraged Lieutenant Mwambura from discussing it. I am concerned that I was
                          punished when I had been ordered to keep quiet.20

             37.	     For some victims, justice was key.21 Unfortunately, even when the alleged perpetrators
                      had gone through the court system and ‘paid for their sins’, their respective
                      communities were not ready to accept them back and indication that justice would
                      not necessarily amount to reconciliation.

                                                                                           Vol u m e III   Chapter THREE




              There are those who are imprisoned, yet they did not a commit crime. After prison, some
              of them are able to continue with their lives. There are those who die in prison. I used
              to see that. They would die of starvation and disease. Many people have suffered. When
              these people leave prison, they should be accepted as human beings instead of being
              viewed as criminals.22

38.	      In cases, where there had been no explanation as to the causes and the reasons
          for violations, the victims demanded to know the truth. Like the rest of the public,
          they were curious to know why they were attacked and the persons behind their
          violations. According to Gregory Onyuro:
              Justice is to know how this thing happened and who caused it. Something cannot
              happen without a cause. Even a disease has a cause and if you want to treat it, you have
              to know the cause.23

39.	      Some of the victims indicated to the Commission that it was necessary for them
          to meet the alleged perpetrators. They urged the Commission to organise for a
          meeting where they would get to their alleged perpetrators and hopefully forgive
          each other. As one witness noted ‘that would be good medicine.’24 This is also
          demonstrated by the testimony of Bernard Orinda Ndege, whose whole family of
          eleven were burnt to death during the 2007/2008 post elections violence. Bernard
          Orinda Ndege informed the Commission that it was his desire to meet the people
          that killed his family members and shared some of the questions that he planned
          to ask them, should the meeting materialize.
              After seeing them and confirming that they are the ones who did this to me and my
              family, I will, first and foremost, ask them to identify me. Who am I? What did I do to
              deserve this kind of treatment? Why was my whole family burnt like charcoal? Why
              was I not taken to court and a legal process instituted and I be convicted? Why did you
              have to do this to me? Why have you done all this to me? So, between me and you,
              what is the next move? What are your views on this? What is the way forward for us all?
              So, therefore, I really feel I should go to court and face those people. If God grants me
              this opportunity, I feel I should not miss it. I want to face the people who did this to
              me and ask them a few questions. I would like us to meet face to face. Instead of them
              seeing me on television or listening to my voice over the radio, I would like to meet
              them. That is why I requested Ocampo, and I am also requesting this Commission now,
              to make sure that those who the Waki Commission listed as the culprits are taken to
              court. Let me be given chance to ask them a few questions. They are the only ones
              who can answer some of these questions. I look forward for the day I will ask them
              those questions.25

                                       REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION                    97
Volume III   Chapter THREE




             40.	    There are victims who strongly felt that perpetrators do not deserve forgiveness
                     and as such they should be held accountable. Even when they claim they were
                     acting on behalf of someone else of merely ‘obeying commands’ they still needed
                     to be held personally accountable and punished.

             Perspectives of Adversely Mentioned Persons
             41.	    As indicated at the beginning of this Chapter, the Commission was required to
                     provide ‘repentant perpetrators or participants in gross human rights violations
                     with a forum to confess their actions as a way of reconciliation’. The Commission
                     sent out invitations to persons who had been adversely mentioned requiring them
                     to not only record their statements and submit memoranda, but also to respond to
                     the allegations made against them.

             42.	    Many of the adversely mentioned persons opted to respond to allegations of their
                     involvements to violations as opposed to recording statements and submitting
                     memorandum when the statement taking exercise was opened. Their response
                     to allegations were characterised by denial of involvement and knowledge of
                     violations. For instance, when asked whether he was either present in a security
                     meeting that is said to have taken place in North Eastern Kenya to discuss ‘a
                     security operation’ just days before the Wagalla Massacre took place, Ambassador
                     Bethuel Kiplagat denied ever attending any meeting in the region and it was only
                     after he was confronted with evidence that he accepted attending the meeting
                     but refuted that ‘security operations’ was discussed in that meeting.

             43.	    Even when some admitted knowing the existence of the violations, they defended
                     and justified their action and at times blamed others for the violations.

             44.	    While some of the adversely mentioned persons showed remorse to the victims
                     for what had taken place and even tendered an apology, others demonstrated
                     indifference and unwillingness to apologise. The difference reactions and responses
                     to allegations by AMPs are discussed below.

             45.	    Some of the AMPS who testified before the Commission showed some semblance
                     of apology and may be remorse but not before they justified their actions. The
                     testimony of Mr. Manasseh Tiema, while responding to question on the security
                     operation that resulted in the Wagalla Massacre demonstrated this:
                             	Commissioner: So you would be the person to answer anything involving
                              whatever went wrong during the operation. Do you in your view think this
                              operation was successful in getting firearms from the communities?




98           REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION
                                                                                      Vol u m e III   Chapter THREE




                	 Mr. Manasseh Tiema: It was successful because according to the firearms
                  that were surrendered physically, the response was okay. I saw the firearms
                  at the police station and I think it improved the situation to some extent.

                	 Commissioner: Mr. Tiema, that is despite the loss of lives?
                	 Mr. Manasseh Tiema: I cannot account for the loss of lives precisely.
                	Commissioner: Look at page 5 of your statement.

                	 Mr. Manasseh Tiema: Let me cut you short there. I am very sorry for the
                  loss of lives despite the fact that we were able to get most of these firearms
                  from the wrong hands.

                	 Commissioner: [...] Mr. Tiema, many people died in this operation. You
                  do not know the exact number and yet you were the head of the District
                  Security Committee. Is that right?

                	 Mr. Manasseh Tiema: I was given a figure.

                	 Commissioner Ojienda: What figure?

                	 Mr. Manasseh Tiema: I was given a figure by the District Special Branch
                  Officer who had collected it from various sources. It said 57 people lost
                  their lives which I am very sorry.
                	 Commissioner Ojienda: You are very sorry for the loss of 57 lives?
                	   Mr. Manasseh Tiema: Yes, I am.26

46.	     Similarly, Benson Kaaria, the Provincial Commissioner in North Eastern Province
         when the Wagalla massacre took place, defended the security operation that
         resulted in the massacre as successful. This was despite the fact that it had been
         officially acknowledged that more than 57 people were killed and only four guns
         recovered.
                	Commissioner: Mr. Kaaria, did I hear you say it was a success?
                	Kaaria: After what they did, it was a success. Other than the incident of
                 people dying, it was a success.
                	 Commissioner: So, the operation was a success and the death of the
                  people was an incident?
                	 Kaaria: It was a success according to us. They had achieved what they
                  wanted. The other one was unfortunate.

Volume III   Chapter THREE




             47.	     Kaaria expressed sympathy for the overall loss of life during the Wagalla operation but
                      he would not be drawn into issuing an apology. The former Provincial Commissioner
                      was absolutely categorical on this: he would not apologise because he had nothing
                      to apologise for. In this Kaaria returned to the underlying theme of all his submissions
                      and representations to the Commission. Responsibility for the operation belonged
                      not with the Provincial Security Committee but with the District Security Committee:

                             	 Commissioner: Would you take full responsibility for the wrong things
                               that occurred during operation?
                             	 Benson Kaaria: I cannot. Everybody has to carry his own cross.
                             	 Commissioner: In this case, who should carry the cross, Mr. Kaaria?
                             	 Benson Kaaria: The DSC Wajir.

             48.	     The exchange continued and Kaaria consolidated his position as sympathetic but
                      unapologetic:
                                 Commissioner: You have no apologies about the deaths; do you have any
                                 Mr. Kaaria?
                                 Mr. Benson Kaaria: Even if I do, I cannot revive…
                                 Commissioner: No! Do you have any?
                                 Benson Kaaria: I sympathise, it was very sad.
                                 Commissioner: You have no apologies as a member of the PSC for having
                                 authorised an operation in which people died?
                                 Benson Kaaria: I cannot apologise.
                                 Commissioner: You cannot!
                                 Benson Kaaria: On behalf of the DC, I cannot.

             49.	     Similarly, another AMP, Ambassador Betheul Kiplagat, could not be easily convinced
                      that the government should apologize for the wrongs committed during the
                      Wagalla security operation despite the fact that he described the incidence as tragic.
                      This was evident from his responses to questions posed to him by three separate
                      Commissioners on this particular subject. Here are his responses to questions posed
                      by one of the Commissioners:27
                             	Commissioner: Do you think at the institutional level, the government
                              should officially apologize because I believe they have not done so to
                              date?

100          REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION
                                                                     Vol u m e III   Chapter THREE




	 Amb Bethuel Kiplagat: It is good to look at the total picture to see what
  kind of response the government can make in that whole situation. We have
  to be very careful in what we do, so that we do not cause more problems.
  So, I think it is important to see the bigger picture.

	Commissioner: So, do I understand that you are not sure whether the
 government should apologize? We will need to have a better understanding
 or a more sophisticated understanding of what the effect of that apology
 would be.

	 Amb Bethuel Kiplagat: Not necessarily; I have not said so. However, we
  need to gather more information which will inform us on what we need
  to do.

	Commissioner: Let me ask that question in another way. What sort of
 information to your mind, would be sufficient to say that the government
 should apologize?

	   Amb Bethuel Kiplagat: Let us continue receiving a lot of these documents
    so that we determine the truth and the facts as they happened. It is
    possible that we will discover other documents which can throw greater
    light into this incident and know exactly what happened. So, I am being
    cautious. Let us gather all the information and then with all the wisdom,
    we see what is it that we can do in order to heal all the people and to heal
    Northern Kenya.

	 Commissioner: I apologize. Maybe, I am beating this horse a little harder,
  but let me ask a similar question in a different way. Let us take this as
  hypothetical. If we find that 57 people died and seven weapons were
  recovered...let us leave aside people harmed, people raped, people kept
  outside for five days in the heat and so on. So, let us just say what we know;
  that, 57 people died and seven weapons were recovered. That was done
  by the government. We may not know exactly who from the government
  did it, but it was done by the government. Given that situation, would you
  suggest that the government should apologize for the loss of lives?

	 Amb Bethuel Kiplagat: It was a terrible loss of lives. The first thing is
  to determine who made the decision to carry out that operation. So far,
  we have not yet done so. I think it is absolutely essential to know which
  individual made that decision.

	 Commissioner: I think we all agree with you on that point. Assuming that,
  that body was a governmental.



                  REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION                  101
Volume III   Chapter THREE




                             	 Amb Bethuel Kiplagat: Then the government should apologize. First and
                               foremost, we should ask ourselves: Who made the decision to carry out
                               that operation?

                             	 Commissioner: So, I understand that if it was a government body that
                               ordered the operation, then obviously, the individuals, the body involved
                               and also the government should apologize? To your mind we do not really
                               understand yet who did order it or who was responsible. We need to keep
                               our minds open with respect to where that specific apology at a lower level
                               should come from. But at the government level, which the question is and
                               particularly where...

                             	 Amb Bethuel Kiplagat: For this case, let us wait. Collect more information
                               and with hindsight, let us look at it and see what specifically we need to
                               do. Something needs to be done; I am very clear in my own mind. As I said
                               here, that was a terrible tragedy.

             50.	    In general, remorse, sorrow and regret were in short supply among many of the
                     AMPs who appeared before the Commission because of the association of these
                     sentiments with responsibility, guilt and culpability.


             Efforts Towards Reconciliation
             51.	    The Commission was not the first institution to work towards national unity, healing
                     and reconciliation. Indeed, there have been other reconciliation efforts carried about
                     by various organisations, governmental as well as non-governmental.

             52.	    The Commission learnt that nearly all the reconciliation efforts were initiated
                     following prolonged massive violence that affected large ethnic populations. As a
                     result, many of such interventions exist primarily in those parts of the country that
                     are referred to as conflict prone areas, the ‘hot spots’. The approaches employed
                     have differed depending on the nature of the conflict. Further, their durations have
                     been dependent on availability of funds to finance them. Most of the reconciliation
                     efforts, until recently, focused more on violence prevention and humanitarian
                     interventions and very little after the violence stopped.

             53.	 The government efforts towards reconciliation have taken various forms
                  including the establishment of commissions of inquiries and task forces in the
                  hope that their findings would lead to reconciliation; the constitutional reform
                  processes; introduction of community policing as well as peace committees;

       disarmament exercises; establishment of conflict early warning mechanism;
       prosecution of alleged to have taken part in actual violations or contributed to
       heightened tensions among communities to act as a deterrence.

54.	   The government was also responsible for the establishment of the National Steering
       Committee on Peace building and Conflict Management (NSC), a multi-agency
       Committee housed within the Office of the President, Ministry of State for Provincial
       Administration and Internal Security for purposes of coordinating peace building and
       conflict management programmes countrywide. The NSC also doubles up as Kenya’s
       Conflict Early Warning and Response Unit (CEWERU) that implements the IGAD-
       CEWARN Mechanism as provided for in the Protocol on the Establishment of Conflict
       Early Warning and Response Mechanism signed in Khartoum in January 2002. NSC
       has facilitated the establishment of Local Peace Committees that have continued to
       conduct peace building and conflict management initiatives across the country.

55.	 Civil society interventions have focused on reconciliation and building new
     relationships amongst the warring communities. Such activities include dialogue,
     negotiations, and problem solving workshops, information, education and
     communication. These have set precedence to the coexistence in places where
     violence was the norm. Several initiatives including conflict early warning have
     played a central role in facilitating a negotiated end to violent conflict among various
     warring communities.

             Challenges
             56.	     While acknowledging that there had been many efforts towards national unity,
                      healing and reconciliation, the Commission sought information, from the
                      people who appeared before it, on the possible reasons why such efforts have
                      been unsuccessful in bringing cohesion and integration among the people
                      of Kenya. The following were some of the main challenges that such persons
                      highlighted.

             Lack of political will
             57.	     Promoting national unity and reconciliation requires strong political support.
                      Such strong political support and leadership has not been available in Kenya
                      even in the aftermath of the 2007/2008 PEV. In January 2009, about a year after
                      the National Accord was signed bringing to a halt the PEV, the Kenya National
                      Dialogue and Reconciliation Monitoring Project observed that:
                          Healing and reconciliation is yet to take place. Political leaders have not been at the
                          centre of healing and reconciliation initiatives. The two principals will have to provide
                          leadership and direction; the two principals should constitute groups to mobilise for
                          national cohesion from the national level to the grassroots.28

             58.	     Two years later, the KNDR Monitoring Project had similar concerns:
                          The Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission (TJRC) and the National Cohesion
                          and Integration Commission (NCIC) have continued their efforts to inquire into human
                          rights violations and prevent future violence, respectively. However, without political
                          support for the work of these commissions, their impact on ethnic relations and deterrence
                          capacity for future dissonance remains uncertain.29

             59.	     In a nutshell, although there is a clear need for healing and reconciliation in Kenya,
                      the political leadership has never really genuinely committed to pursuing these
                      goals. On the contrary, political leaders have often undermined reconciliation
                      and peace building efforts because of vested and other interests.30

             Reconciliation and access to social goods
             60.	     Change of attitude and acceptance between former hostile groups in itself
                      cannot amount to reconciliation. There is need for the government to put in place
                      social processes and structures, as well as institutions to ensure reconciliation

                                                                                                                    Vol u m e III      Chapter THREE




         processes are not only promoted, but also, where they exist, are solidified and
         maintained. The absence of such structures and institutions has meant that the
         reconciliation efforts in the country have not born any meaningful fruits.

61.	     Various stakeholders that appeared before the Commission during its hearings
         stated that it was not possible for reconciliation to take place when people
         lived under conditions that continuously reminded them of the suffering they
         went through. Accordingly, many victims stated that they wanted some form of
         compensation that would help them come out of destitution.
              My expectations are that the Government will remember the victims, not just
              those who are living in tents, but also those who are integrated with the rest of
              the community that is trying to assist them. That is what I am recommending. I am
              also requesting that the victims be paid some kind of compensation so that they
              can look for another place where they can stay because going back to where they
              were before would not give them peace due to what they went through. When they
              remember what they went through, they still live in anxiety. They should be given
              some form of compensation so that they can see where they want to go and live in
              peace and settle. So, I would like to recommend that. If the victims think that they
              can be resettled in an area of their own choice that would be good. That is what I
              request the Government.31

62.	     While testifying about the destruction of property experienced in 2007/2008
         post election violence, Hon. Samuel Omweri Kibwage wondered how people
         were expected to reconcile when they were still struggling to earn a livelihood:
              How do you reconcile such cases? How do you help? So we feel the Commission should
              help us. Even if we are seeking peace, some of these people should be compensated just
              to comfort them and wipe their tears.32

63.	     While addressing the question of cattle rustling, Hon. Samuel Omweri Kibwage
         reiterated his earlier stand by stating as follows:
              So we would like to appeal that some compensation to these particular cases be
              given. Even those who lost animals, some of them have lost the entire herd, some
              maybe a few. But if they want to be compensated, they should be compensated. It is
              true we want peace and reconciliation, we want to trust each other but when these
              people suffer, even if you tell them to keep quiet and their animals will be recovered,
              it is like telling a hungry person to stay on and that the hunger will pass on. He will
              never forget.33

             Victim Participation and Follow-up Mechanism
             64.	     Witnesses at the Commission’s hearings noted that despite the various efforts by
                      both governmental and non-government organisations towards reconciliation,
                      nothing much seems to change. Communities remain polarised and tension
                      continues to be heightened. Many of the witnesses felt that the conflicting
                      communities and in other cases, the concerned individuals, have not been
                      involved in such efforts/processes. They indicated there was need for a ‘bottom
                      top’ approach to ensure that reconciliation efforts are not only home-grown but
                      are also sustainable.

             65.	     Other witnesses stated that there has been a failure to follow up such reconciliation
                      processes and to evaluate them from time to time to guarantee success. The
                      result has been that many reconciliation efforts have collapsed as soon as they
                      were initiated. The Commission learnt that there has been duplication of efforts
                      which unfortunately are uncoordinated and not harmonized.

             Root causes and priorities
             66.	     While speaking of the possible solutions to the conflict in the Tana Delta region
                      between the farmers and the pastoralists, witnesses informed the Commission of
                      how Government agencies were keen on apprehending perceived perpetrators
                      of the violence as opposed to addressing the root causes of the violence and
                      reconciling the warring communities. The result has been recurrence of the
                      violence as soon as such agencies leave the area. In this regard, Mr. Mohamed
                      Doyo Maro stated as follows:
                          These attacks have happened three times. The first time up to the second time it was a
                          problem. By the third time, it had spread to the entire Tana River from Mbalambala up to
                          Kipini. We have had a problem for nearly one year. When the Government would come
                          all they would do would be to apprehend people, but I told them that as elders we must
                          intervene. I was one of the members of the committee who tried to negotiate with the
                          Orma elders, the Wardei elders and the Pokomo elders. I took 21 elders from our side
                          and 21 from their side and we sat down and discussed until the issue abated slowly by
                          slowly until there was no longer any conflict and now we eat together.34

             67.	     He further accused the Government of taking sides and therefore seen as an unfair
                      arbiter in the conflict further complicating the situation and making it difficult for
                      lasting peace to be achieved. He explained the situation thus:
                          There is one other issue which has come up which I should mention before I forget. This
                          is the issue of security which has led to our not living in harmony. We have always had

             problems regarding security with our neighbours because we are farmers and they are
             pastoralists. They are the ones who are usually the aggressors because they bring their
             livestock into our farms. In 2001, there was a conflict between us and the others, but
             instead of the Government being neutral to ensure security in a fair way, we realized that
             the Kenya Police Reservists had been deployed in so many areas. The weapons being held
             by the Pokomos were withdrawn by the Government. This left us exposed and led to the
             problem that we have had. Such issues are the ones which lead us to believe that it is a
             deliberate plot by the Government against us as a community to marginalise us and deny
             us our rights.35

68.	     The Commission learnt that whereas victims of violations have been willing
         to forgive, persons alleged to have participated or facilitated violations have
         been reluctant to not only admit their involvement but also to seek forgiveness.
         The perpetrators reluctance to apologise or show remorse for their action has
         further complicated the search for reconciliation in the country. It is unfortunate
         that most of the victims of violations have died without having their suffering
         acknowledged.


Opportunities
69.	     During the Commission’s mandate, there were various initiatives and reform
         processes that took place which had direct impact on and provided an
         opportunity to foster national unity, healing and reconciliation in the country.
         Key among them were the promulgation of the Constitution of Kenya 2010, the
         enactment of various legislation, establishment of institutions, as well as various
         reforms in various sectors especially the judiciary and the police service.

70.	     As part of the National Accord, which restored order after Kenya’s post-2007
         election violence, Parliament enacted the National Cohesion and Integration
         Act (2008). The Act outlaws discrimination on ethnic and other social grounds,
         and provides for the establishment of the National Cohesion and Integration
         Commission (NCIC) whose mandate is to: “facilitate and promote equality of
         opportunity, good relations, harmony and peaceful co-existence between
         persons of the different ethnic and racial communities of Kenya, and to advise the
         Government on all aspects thereof.” The Act is the most explicit mechanism that
         has been set up to encourage national cohesion and integration by outlawing
         discrimination on “ethnic grounds”, where ethnicity is defined to include race,
         religion, tribe and culture.

Volume III   Chapter THREE




             71.	     The Act also criminalise harassment, hate speech, threatening, abusive or insulting
                      conduct, and discrimination in employment based on ethnicity. In outlawing the
                      distribution of resources by a public officer in an ethnically inequitable manner,
                      the Act sets 30 per cent as the maximum share of employees of a public office that
                      may come from one ethnic group. The Act and the NCIC present a mechanism to
                      effectively manage the effects of hate speech, skewed employment in the public
                      service, and discrimination on ethnic grounds, which have presented significant
                      challenges to the achievement of national cohesion and integration in Kenya since
                      the attainment of independence in 1963.

             72.	     The Constitution of Kenya promulgated in 2010 has a number of provisions
                      that touch specifically on national cohesion and integration. Article 10 of the
                      Constitution emphasises the national values and principles of governance,
                      including national unity, social justice, inclusiveness, and equity. Its Bill of Rights
                      provides for equality and freedom from discrimination, guaranteeing the basic
                      economic and social rights of all, while encouraging respect for diversity and
                      fostering a sense of belonging. Further, the provisions on devolution means that
                      all communities will access services and this is likely, if managed well, to restore a
                      sense of belonging. Indeed, witnesses expressed new hope in the Constitution, as
                      seen in the testimony of Mr. Charles Omondi Oyaya:
                          But coming back to your question, our Constitution in the preamble says: “PROUD of
                          our ethnic, cultural and religious diversity---”. It does not presuppose that one Kenya
                          means a faceless Kenya, but Kenya that is united by core values that bring all of them
                          together as they celebrate their diversity. Again, I would like to say that we have a lot of
                          hope in the Constitution; that it has created structures that celebrate diversity but also
                          unite Kenyans on the things that unite them, and education is one of them. So, it is not
                          by default that two key institutions are not devolved; education and the Judiciary, and
                          I think this is key. We cannot afford to be a divided Kenya. I would like my child to be
                          proud of who he is as much as he is proud of being a Kenyan. At the moment, if you ask
                          any Kenyan “Why are you a Kenyan?” he or she will say that either because he or she has
                          an identity card or, by accident, he or she was born in Kenya.36

             73.	     There exist a number of legislation which if implemented to the fullest would foster
                      not just national reconciliation, but also integration and cohesion. Key among
                      them include: National Cohesion and Integration Act No. 12 of 2008; the Political
                      Parties Act No. 11 of 2011; Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission Act No. 22 of
                      2011; National Gender and Equality Act No. 15 of 2011; Persons with Disabilities
                      Act No. 14 of 2003 among other...The foregoing frameworks give rise to policies
                      that have the ability for promoting national unity and reconciliation.

Conclusion
74.	     Healing and reconciliation requires political leadership; it cannot be left to faith
         based and other civil society organisations at the grassroots. The government should
         provide national direction especially by making clear policies on reconciliation
         followed by a commitment to implement those policies.
             Now, on recommendations on how to address these conflicts, I think the most critical
             thing and the first step is the policy approach. We really have to take very decisive
             and brave steps in enacting and developing policies that we also implement with the
             same strength and commitment. Peace and reconciliation need to really have sound
             political and policy on which you can hinge them, and the rest of the initiatives. These
             have to be clear, concise and focused and really strong guidelines supported by firm
             commitment especially through implementing decisions. If we are faltering weak or
             kigeugeu, as many people say around nowadays, we will not reach far. Two, we really
             need to take a very open, robust and strong reconciliation and integration approach
             on a long term basis. Our problems are historical and deep rooted. We cannot afford
             to come up with a wishy washy short term project based one off initiatives. We really
             have to come up with a robust reconciliation process that is enshrined in cohesion,
             integration and peace building and other related mechanisms, linking with an
             institution like the National Cohesion and Integrity Commission, which has a long
             term mandate in engaging in this area and various other institutions. If possible,
             create other institutions to support those that are existing or in existence and
             strengthen them. The education and skill development approach is a very important
             one. It is actually a lifelong business and we really need to invest in education and
             skill enhancement for personal and societal growth. We can only achieve most of the
             changes that we desire through this approach.37

75.	     There is need for inter-community dialogue facilitated by the communities under
         conflict. While commenting on how the conflict along the Tana River between
         farmers and pastoralists would be resolved, Mr. Wilson Sinema Timothy Komora
         stated as follows:
             I know that there are committees that are trying to bring all the communities together
             in security issues. The important thing that we would want is that these committees
             should go on sensitizing both areas, so that each community will respect the other.
             We, as pastoralists, know that farming or agriculture is what the farmer depends on
             and it is just as important as his livestock so that every person respects the property of
             the other person. If we have that respect there will be no problem.38

             76.	     Answering to a similar question posed by a Commissioner on the ability of the
                      community peace committee to foster reconciliation, Mr. Samuel Omweri stated
                      as follows:
                           When they [elders] sit, they will address all injustices on both sides. They will also look
                           into the origin of these problems and involve the Government and probably come
                           up with a lasting peace in the region. I believe they will be able to reconcile all the
                           communities living along border. With involvement of the political leadership, they will
                           succeed.39

             77.	     To make this reconciliation sustainable, it is necessary to build confidence among the
                      various parties to the conflict, through working together towards interdependence
                      by reconstructing the social, economic and cultural life of the community, as well
                      as by building a shared common future. Confidence will help to open channels for
                      dialogue about the past, without obstruction from negative emotions. Embracing
                      the past and the future is important in shaping the present.40

     One key mandate of the Commission is to ensure ethnic diversity in
       public employment. For example, Section 7 of the National Cohesion and
       Integration Act, 2008 that States in Part; “All public establishments shall
       seek to represent the diversity of the people of Kenya in the employment
       of staff. No public establishment shall have more than one third of its
       staff from the same ethnic community”.




     Highlight the need to promote equality of opportunity for all staff and
       eliminate discrimination on ethnic and racial basis.
     Provide information that will be used to develop inclusive employment
       policy in the public (and private sector in Kenya).



     Freedom from discrimination is a fundamental right espoused in the NCI
       Act, 2008 and other international legislations such as the UN Declaration
       on the elimination of all forms of discrimination
     Bringing equality and equity to the workplace has significant economic
       benefits, too. Employers who practice equality and equity have access to
       a larger and more diverse workforce.
     Diversity in workplace promotes understanding & appreciation of socio
       cultural differences → unity.


   Letters and questionnaire were sent to all the public Universities and
     Constituent Colleges and copied to the Ministry of Higher Education
     asking them to provide details of their employees covering date of
     employment, district of origin, ethnic affiliation, among others.

     Currently, Kenya has seven public universities and sixteen constituent
       colleges (including Rongo University College which has been gazetted but
       has neither admitted students nor employed staff). This ethnic audit
       covered the public universities and the constituent colleges.

     Six Public Universities and 9 Constituent Colleges responded and were
       analysed. Some universities and university colleges submitted both
       analysed and raw data.

               The distribution of public universities and their constituent colleges clearly
               shows the North/ South divide in Kenya which has gradually increased since
               the precolonial times and has been reinforced in the post independence era.
               For example, there is not a single university or constituent college above 20
               North. Attempts to place satellite campuses in the ‘North’ have been marred by
               difficulties in infrastructural development among other problems. For instance
               Moi University Northern Kenya Campus was opened on 1st September 2009 in
               Garissa. Nevertheless, the campus experienced a lot of challenges in its
               operationalization and has never picked up.

               Kenyatta University on the other hand opened an Institute of Open, Distance
               and eLearning located in Garissa Town. The Garissa Regional Centre serves all
               the Districts of North Eastern Province as well as Mwingi District in Eastern
               Province and Tana River District in Coast Province.

                     however negligible (0.13%) while others such as that of the Kikuyu
                     community is significant (about 11%).

                     and Maasai.

               In the public universities and constituent colleges, the five largest communities
                  the Kikuyu, Luhya, Kalenjin, Luo and Kamba who together make up about
                 66% of the Kenyan population constitute over 81% of the total workforce. This
                 severs opportunities to enhance the face of Kenya in these institutions thus
                 excluding the other more than 37 ethnic communities. For example, in the six
                 public universities analysed, the representation of the five big communities is
                 over 86% (see Table 2).

 This audit reveals that most of the staff in the public universities and
   constituent colleges come from the communities within which the institutions
   are located – see Table 3.
                                           
 The spread of universities in Kenya excludes the northern part of the country
   with most of them located within Nairobi and its environs.

 Kenyans seem to perceive the university as a job creation enterprise for the
   community within which the university is located. It may be in this perspective
   that some regions agitate for the establishment of public universities in their
   areas.


 However, we note that despite the fact that Universities are national, drawing
   their students from all parts of the country and, in spite of the fact that their
   recruitment for regular programmes are national as well, locals can be
   employed mostly to undertake subordinate duties as part of the extension
   services of the university to the surrounding communities.

 The other universities located within ethnically mixed areas elicit assorted
   symptoms with some kind of ‘informal’ balance between two or three
   communities. For instance, Egerton University located in Njoro, Nakuru has
   28.9% from the Kikuyu community and 25.8% from the Kalenjin Community.
   On the other hand, Multimedia University which is located in Ongata Rongai
   has 25% of its employees from the Kikuyu community, 21% from the Luhyia
   community and 20% from the Luo community.

                  have the percentages of the highest ethnic community in their employment
                  reduce among the senior staff. Notably, while the general employment in Moi
                  University has 55% from the Kalenjin community, this reduces to 36.2%
                  among senior staff.

                On the other hand, the percentage of the highest represented ethnic
                  community in three universities increase in representation at senior staff level.
                  Kenyatta University and Multimedia University exhibits an increase in the
                  percentage of the Kikuyu at Senior Staff level by 4% each.

                However, Masinde Muliro University seems to demonstrate the same trend both
                  generally and at Senior Staff employment with the Luhyas holding 68% at both
                  levels.

 The following universities violate the provision of the NCI Act, 2008 which
   stipulates that ‘no public establishment shall have more than one third of its
   staff from the same ethnic community’. In this regard, the institutions
   mentioned in this section have more that 33.3% of their employees from one
   community.

 As seen in Table 7, universities such as Masinde Muliro and Moi have more
   than 50% of their employees from one community. The situation is worse in
   constituent colleges (see Table 8).


 It should however, be noted that most of the constituent colleges inherited
   most of the staff who were in these colleges before they were converted in
   university colleges.

   Letters should be written to these universities and constituent colleges
   highlighting their areas of strength and weaknesses – and asking them to make
                                          14
   deliberate efforts to comply with the constitutional requirement on ethnic
   diversity in recruitment and comply with the NCI Act, 2008.


 Meetings should be held with the various chief executives in these universities
   and officers from the parent ministries to discuss the way forward. These
   forums could also be used to gather information that would feed into the policy
   development.
