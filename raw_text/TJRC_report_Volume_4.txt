Foreword

This volume contains the core operational legacy of the Commission’s work: its findings
and recommendations; the blueprint for the institution tasked with monitoring and
implementing the recommendations; and the Commission’s proposed reparations policy
and framework.

One of the most anticipated parts of a truth commission report is always the commission’s
findings and recommendations. Having spent four years engaging with Kenyans
throughout the width and breadth of the country, including over a year of public
hearings, the expectations of those who followed the process are understandably high,
notwithstanding the Commission’s efforts to educate the public about its powers and
limitations. The Commission’s statement taking form provided a specific avenue through
which any Kenyan could suggest recommendations to the Commission. Every witness
who testified before the Commission was asked what he or she would recommend given
the violations they had witnessed or experienced. The Commission was thus presented
with a wealth of information and creative ideas concerning our recommendations,
including recommendations for individual and collective forms of reparations.

The first chapter in this volume sets out the Commission’s findings and recommendations.
The findings are based upon the facts and analysis in the Report itself, as well as additional
research and investigations undertaken by the Commission. It is, understandably, one of
the most highly anticipated parts of the Report. The Commission received a broad range
of ideas concerning recommendations. Not all of them could be included. In choosing
which recommendations to include, the Commission was conscious of, on the one hand,
honoring the commitment and sacrifice of the thousands of people who participated
in the process, and the thousands who suffered and continue to suffer from the legacy
of historical injustices and gross violations of human rights, and on the other hand,
the understandable limitations of a government that has a broad mandate in areas of
economic development, welfare, education, and security. In other words, the Commission
strove to make meaningful and reasonable recommendations which, it is hoped, will
have a higher chance of implementation. Better to have fewer recommendations that
are implemented, than many recommendations that gather dust on a bureaucrat’s shelf.

The Commission was conscious of the fact that one of the biggest challenges that has
traditionally faced truth commission recommendations is the lack of political will by

            government to implement them. Every truth commission before this one has made
            recommendations that were not implemented in a timely fashion or, in most cases, not
            implemented at all. Often, the political pressure to implement the recommendations of a
            truth commission fades as soon as the commission finishes its work and issues its report.
            The drafters of the TJR Act clearly had this challenge in mind when they specifically
            empowered the Commission to design a monitoring and implementation mechanism to
            ensure that its recommendations are followed and implemented. The second chapter in
            this volume sets out the rationale for creating such an institution; describes the institution
            that should be created; and provides a justification for the same institution.

            Lastly, the third chapter sets out the Commission’s proposed reparations policy and
            framework. Reparations are key to the legitimacy of a truth commission, and particularly
            for this truth commission which is the first of its kind to have “Justice” in its title. Justice
            was achieved in part by the acknowledgement the Commission provided to witnesses
            who engaged with the Commission through the statement taking process and public
            hearings. Justice was also achieved in part by the identifying of individuals or institutions
            responsible for specific historical injustices and gross violations of human rights. Justice is
            further achieved by the recommendations the Commission made with respect to further
            investigations and prosecutions, set out in Appendix 1 of Chapter 1 of this Volume.

            Equally important, however, to furthering justice is providing reparations to those
            who have been wronged. As set out in this chapter, international law makes clear that
            justice demands reparations for those who have been wronged. Reparations are not
            the same as compensation, though reparations may take the form of compensation to
            individuals. Reparations may also consist of memorials, community facilities (such as
            health clinics, schools, etc.), and other mechanisms by which the suffering of victims is
            acknowledged and addressed. The reparations framework provided here, along with the
            wealth of information the Commission collected in its four years of work, will guide the
            implementation mechanism in developing specific reparations awards. The Commission
            has recommended that the Government set aside an initial Ksh 500 million for reparations.
            It is not enough to redress all of the violations described in this Report, but we hope that
            it will provide a beginning that can later be supplemented.

                                                                               ONE
     Findings and Recommendations

Introduction
1.	       One of the most anticipated parts of a truth commission report is always the
          commission’s findings and recommendations. This Chapter provides a catalogue
          of the Commission’s findings and recommendations.

2.	       The Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Act (TJR Act) required the Truth, Justice and
          Reconciliation Commission (the Commission) to make findings in respect of gross
          violations of human rights inflicted on persons by the State, public institutions
          and holders of public office, both serving and retired, between 12 December
          1963 and 28 February 2008. The Act stipulated that such findings must include
          the Commission’s conclusions on: the antecedents, circumstances, factors and
          context of such violations; the causes, nature and extent thereof; and perpetrator
          responsibility and motives.1 The Act further required the Commission to summarize
          its findings in this Report.2 This Chapter summarizes the main findings of the
          Commission as required by section 48 of the TJR Act.

3.	       The findings of the Commission are based upon the totality of its investigations
          and research. These include the detailed analysis of the statements it received, the
          investigations it carried out, conclusions drawn from its open and closed hearings,
          and the study of a large number of primary source documents and materials.

Volume IV   Chapter ONE




            4.	       The Commission has made findings of responsibility against individuals
                      where such persons had an adequate opportunity to respond to allegations in
                      interviews, hearings or in writing. However, a significant number of adversely
                      mentioned persons did not respond to the Commission’s invitation to respond to
                      allegations levelled against them. In the absence of a response from such AMPs,
                      the Commission presumed the allegations as levelled against them to be truthful.
                      This is in accordance with the jurisprudence of quasi-judicial human rights bodies.
                      In the practice of the African Commission on Human Rights and Peoples’ Rights
                      and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) the facts alleged
                      in a complainant’s petition is presumed to be true if the respondent state has not
                      provided responsive information during the maximum period set by the respective
                      commissions.3 Similarly, the Human Rights Committee has established the practice
                      of drawing its decision on the basis of information provided by the complainant
                      when the respondent state fails to participate in the communications procedure.4

            5.	       In making findings of responsibility against individuals and groups, the Commission
                      employed the balance of probabilities standard of proof. This standard is akin to
                      the preponderance of evidence normally used in civil cases. It is the same standard
                      used by similar truth commissions internationally. The Commission was not a
                      court of law and therefore the finding it has made in reference to an adversely
                      mentioned person is not a finding of guilt.

            6.	       It is noteworthy that some compared this Commission’s work with that of the
                      International Criminal Court (ICC) or asked about the relationship between the
                      Commission and the ICC. As noted, the Commission was not a court of law, and
                      while some of the purposes of the Commission were similar to that of the ICC,
                      they were very different institutions. First, the Commission was a more victim-
                      centered institution. The ICC, while more victim-centered than many courts, still
                      has as the subject of its primary focus the suspect, and determining by a high
                      standard of proof whether the suspect is guilty of the charges alleged. Second,
                      the Commission was focused on historical narratives, context, and perspectives of
                      victims, perpetrators, and witnesses. The ICC, like all courts, is much more narrowly
                      focused. As a result of these and other differences, the Commission was able to
                      interact with, and provide participation for, far more victims and other Kenyans
                      than the ICC. Third, the ICC’s temporal mandate is relatively narrow – from the time
                      of the ratification of the Rome Statute by Kenya on 1 June 2005 to 26 November
                      2009 (the date of the ICC Prosecutor’s filing of a request for the initiation of an

2           REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION
                                                                                        Vol u m e IV   Chapter ONE




          investigation into the Kenya situation). The Commission’s temporal mandate is far
          broader, from 12 December 1963 to 28 February 2008, and in fact extends before
          and after that period.

7.	       Some also asked about the role of the Commission with respect to the 2007 PEV.
          As noted earlier, it was the 2007 PEV that provided the immediate impetus for the
          creation of the Commission, and that period of Kenya’s history is clearly within
          the temporal mandate of the Commission. Consequently the Commission heard
          a good deal of testimony concerning the PEV. The Commission, however, limited
          the amount of resources that it devoted to that period for three reasons. First,
          the period of post-election violence was a very small part of the time period in
          which the Commission was to examine historical injustices and gross violations
          of human rights. Second, a previous commission of inquiry – the Commission of
          Inquiry on the Post-Election Violence, also known as the Waki Commission – had
          focused specifically and narrowly on violations during this period. Third, through
          its focus on initially six, and now three, individuals, the ICC was and is investigating
          this period of Kenya’s history. In other words, it was the view of the Commission
          that a good deal of time and resources had already been, and were continuing
          to be, focused on this period within the mandate. Without commenting on the
          quality of either of these separate investigative institutions, it was the considered
          view of the Commission that its limited time and resources would be better served
          focusing on those broad areas of the mandate that were not the subject of any
          other investigative process.

8.	       The TJR Act also required the Commission to make recommendations concerning
          the reforms and other measures, whether legal, political, or administrative
          as may be needed to achieve the objects of the Commission.5 In this regard,
          the objects of the Commission were to promote peace, justice, national unity,
          healing, and reconciliation.6 In particular the Commission was enjoined to make
          recommendations regarding:

          	    Prosecution;

          	    Specific actions to be taken in furtherance of the Commission’s findings;

          	    Legal and administrative measures to address specific concerns identified by
                the Commission;

          	    Measures to prevent the future occurrence of human rights violations.

                                 REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION                     3
Volume IV   Chapter ONE




            9.	      The Commission was authorized to make recommendations concerning any
                     other matter with a view to promoting or achieving justice, national unity and
                     reconciliation within the context of the Act.7

            10.	     The Commission was also mandated to recommend the grant of amnesty in
                     respect of certain offences. However, as explained in the mandate chapter of this
                     Report, the Commission did not process any amnesty applications and as such no
                     recommendations pertaining to amnesty have been made. The Commission was
                     also mandated to recommend a reparation framework that would serve as the
                     basis for repairing the harm suffered by victims and survivors of gross violations
                     of human rights and historical injustices. Chapter Three of this Volume sets out the
                     Commission’s recommendations in relation to reparations. Finally, the Commission
                     was required to make recommendations on the mechanism and framework for
                     the implementation of its recommendations. Chapter Two of this Volume makes
                     recommendations relating to such a mechanism.

            11.	     In essence, the legal framework provided by the TJR Act facilitated the making
                     of comprehensive recommendations on a range of topics. As such, and to
                     facilitate implementation and monitoring, the Commission has tried to make
                     recommendations which are specific, feasible and which have measurable short,
                     medium or long-term goals. Recommendations which strike a resonance with
                     the Kenyan people are likely to be the subject of mobilization and lobbying. Such
                     recommendations are more likely to be implemented by the Government. Each
                     recommendation has been directed to a specific entity or office holder.

            12.	     The recommendations made by the Commission are a synthesis of views expressed
                     to the Commission and the Commission’s own reflection on the findings reached
                     with respect to various violations and issues. The recommendations reflect views
                     expressed to the commission by victims, witnesses, civil society organisations,
                     experts and government officials who interacted with the Commission. With
                     respect to victims, the Commission solicited their views on recommendations
                     through the statement taking process. Additional recommendations were
                     proposed to the Commission by those who testified during the individual, thematic
                     and institutional hearings held around the country.

            13.	     With respect to recommendations concerning the investigation and possible
                     prosecution of an individual, the following shall apply: The DPP or appropriate
                     authority shall immediately commence an investigation into the individual named.

                                                                                 Vol u m e IV   Chapter ONE




       Unless otherwise provided in the specific recommendations, such an investigation
       shall conclude no later than twelve months after the issuance of this Report. At
       the completion of such investigation the DDP or appropriate authority shall make
       an immediate determination concerning whether the evidence warrants a criminal
       prosecution. The DPP or appropriate authority shall immediately make that
       determination public, and shall include in that public statement detailed reasons
       justifying its decision.

14.	   The above procedure with respect to investigations for possible prosecution is a
       recommendation of the Commission, and as with all recommendations as set out
       in the TJR Act is binding as a matter of law.

15.	   In thinking about and formulating recommendations, the Commission took note
       of the fact that the Commission was established as part of the Kenya National
       Dialogue and Reconciliation process which led to the initiation of numerous
       reforms and mechanisms intended to address long-standing historical issues. As a
       consequence, many of the issues that the Commission was tasked to address have
       been addressed (either in whole or in part) or are in the process of been addressed.
       For instance, the Constitution of Kenya 2010 has dealt with or laid the basis for
       addressing such issues as historical land injustices and economic marginalization.

16.	   The Commission was also aware that there have been established in recent time a
       number of permanent institutions charged with dealing with the very issues that
       the Commission was mandated to inquire into. These include:
       	   The National Land Commission, which has the mandate to deal with, among
            other issues, historical land injustices;

       	   The National Cohesion and Integration Commission, which has the mandate
            to foster national cohesion and unity;

       	   The National Gender and Equality Commission, which has the mandate to
            promote and protect the rights of minority and vulnerable groups, including
            women and marginalized groups;

       	   The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission, which has the mandate to
            investigate cases of corruption and economic crimes;

       	   The Commission on Revenue Allocation, which has the mandate to determine
            allocation of revenue; and

       	   The Independent Police Oversight Authority, which has the mandate to, inter
            alia, inquire into killings committed by the police.

Volume IV   Chapter ONE




            17.	       In essence, the Commission’s work evolved at a particular historical moment that
                       coincided with a reform process. Thus, the Commission viewed its role as that of
                       building on the existing reform initiatives.

            18.	       Like truth commissions before it, the Commission had to consider whether or not
                       to recommend lustration. The term lustration is derived from the Latin lustrum and
                       refers to a process of purification. In the field of transitional justice, the process
                       of lustration has been used to remove from public office individuals who are
                       associated with past human rights violations. It has also been used to prevent
                       individuals associated with human rights violations from holding public office in
                       the future.

            19.	       The United Nations recognize the important role that vetting and lustration
                       can play in the prevention of future human rights abuses and violations by the
                       State.8 Lustration can serve two purposes: preventing the recurrence of human
                       violations by public officers who have committed such violations in the past, and
                       restoring the population’s trust in the State after a period of systematic human
                       rights violations.

            20.	       The process of lustration has been controversial in many societies when it has been
                       used to remove from office all individuals associated with past political regimes.
                       For example, lustration has been used in former communist countries to remove
                       all individuals associated with the past communist regime, and in Iraq to remove
                       all officials associated with the deposed Baath Party.9 In the context of Kenya, this
                       kind of mass action is not recommended.

            21.	       However, the prevalence of impunity throughout the history of Kenya compelled
                       the Commission to consider lustration for past abuses committed by individuals
                       while acting in an official capacity. The Commission considered that tackling
                       impunity is a necessary and urgent step in the full restoration of the rule of law in
                       Kenya, in establishing lasting peace and stability, and in fostering reconciliation.
                       For this reason, the Commission has recommended that specific individuals
                       should not hold public office in Kenya’s constitutional order on account of their
                       past conduct and/or decisions which resulted in gross violations of human
                       rights.

                                                                                   Vol u m e IV   Chapter ONE




Primary Findings
22.	   The Commission finds that between 1895 and 1963, the British Colonial administration
       in Kenya was responsible for unspeakable and horrific gross violations of human
       rights. In order to establish its authority in Kenya, the colonial government employed
       violence on the local population on an unprecedented scale. Such violence included
       massacres, torture and ill-treatment and various forms of sexual violence.

23.	   The Commission also finds that the British Colonial administration adopted a
       divide and rule approach to the local population that created a negative dynamic
       of ethnicity, the consequences of which are still being felt today. At the same
       time the Colonial administration alienated large amounts of highly productive
       land from the local population, and removed communities from their ancestral
       lands.

24.	   The Commission finds that between 1963 and 1978, President Jomo Kenyatta
       presided over a government that was responsible for numerous gross violations of
       human rights. These violations included:

       	   in the context of the Shifta War, killings, torture, collective punishment, and
            denial of basic needs (food, water and health care);

       	   political assassinations of Pio Gama Pinto, Tom Mboya and J.M. Kariuki;

       	   arbitrary detention of political opponents and activists; and

       	   illegal and irregular acquisition of land by the highest government officials
            and their political allies

25.	   The Commission finds that between 1978 and 2002, President Daniel Arap Moi
       presided over a government that was responsible for numerous gross violations of
       human rights. These violations include:

       	   massacres;

       	   unlawful detentions, and systematic and widespread torture and ill-treatment
            of political and human rights activists;

       	   assassinations, including that of Dr. Robert Ouko;

       	   illegal and irregular allocations of land; and

       	   economic crimes and grand corruption.

Volume IV   Chapter ONE




            26.	    The Commission finds that between 2002 and 2008, President Mwai Kibaki presided
                    over a government that was responsible for numerous gross violations of human
                    rights. These violations include:
                     	   unlawful detentions;
                     	   extra judicial killings; and
                     	   economic crimes and grand corruption

            27.	    The Commission finds that state security agencies, particularly the Kenya Police
                    and the Kenya Army, have been the main perpetrators of bodily integrity violations
                    of human rights in Kenya including massacres, enforced disappearances, torture
                    and ill-treatment, and sexual violence.

            28.	    The Commission finds that Northern Kenya (comprised of the former North Eastern
                    Province, Upper Eastern and North Rift) has been the epicenter of gross violations
                    of human rights by state security agencies. Almost without exception, security
                    operations in Northern Kenya have been accompanied by massacres of largely
                    innocent citizens, systematic and widespread torture, rape and sexual violence of
                    girls and women, looting and burning of property, and the killing and confiscation
                    of cattle and other livestock.

            29.	    The Commission finds that state security agencies have as a matter of course
                    in dealing with banditry and maintaining peace and order employed collective
                    punishment against communities regardless of the guilt or innocence of individual
                    members of such communities.

            30.	    The Commission finds that during the mandate period the state adopted economic
                    and other policies that resulted in the economic marginalization of five key regions
                    in the country: North Eastern and Upper Eastern; Coast; Nyanza; Western; and
                    North Rift.

            31.	    The Commission finds that historical grievances over land constitute the single
                    most important driver of conflicts and ethnic tension in Kenya. Close to 50 percent
                    of statements and memorandum received by the Commission related to or touched
                    on claims over land.

            32.	    The Commission finds that women and girls have been the subject of state-
                    sanctioned systematic discrimination. Although discrimination against women and
                    girls is rooted in patriarchal cultural practices, the state has traditionally failed to curb
                    harmful traditional practices that affect women’s enjoyment of human rights.

33.	   The Commission finds that despite the special status accorded to children in
       Kenyan society, they have been subjected to untold and unspeakable atrocities
       including killings, physical assault and sexual violence.

34.	   The Commission finds that minority groups and indigenous people suffered state-
       sanctioned systematic discrimination during the mandate period. In particular,
       minority groups have suffered discrimination in relation to political participation
       and access to national identity cards. Other violations that minority groups and
       indigenous people have suffered include: collective punishment, and violation of
       land rights and the right to development.



   Recommendations
         	   The Commission recommends that the President, within six months of the issuance
             of this Report, offer a public and unconditional apology to the people of Kenya for all
             injustices and gross violations of human rights committed during the mandate period.
         	   The Commission recommends that State security agencies, and in particular the
             Kenya Police, Kenya Defence Forces, and the National Intelligence Service apologize
             for gross violations of human rights committed by their predecessor agencies
             between 12 December 1963 and 28 February 2008, especially acts of extra-judicial
             killings, arbitrary and prolonged detention, torture and sexual violence.
         	   The Commission recommends that the Kenyan Government considers entering
             into negotiations with the British government with a view to seeking compensation
             for victims of atrocities and injustices committed during the colonial period by
             agents of the colonial administration. This should be done within 12 months of the
             issuance of this Report.
         	   The Commission recommends that the British government offer a public and
             unconditional apology to the people of Kenya for all injustices and gross violations
             of human rights committed by the colonial administration between 1895 and 1963.
         	   The Commission recommends that the Judiciary apologize to the people of Kenya for
             failing to address impunity effectively and perform its role of deterrence to prevent
             the perpetration of gross human rights violations, during the period between 12
             December 1963 and 28 February 2008.
         	   The Commission recommends the creation of a National Human Rights Day on
             10 December, to coincide with the international Human Rights Day, which will be
             used to promote respect for human rights in Kenya.
         	   The Commission recommends that the judiciary fast-tracks the establishment of the
             International Crimes Division of the High Court which shall be responsible for the trial
             of some of the cases referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions for investigations
             and prosecution.

Volume IV   Chapter ONE




                      	   The Commission recommends that the fast-tracking of the enactment of human rights
                          related laws as envisaged by the Constitution of Kenya, including on: freedom of the
                          media; fair hearing; and rights of persons held in custody or detained.
                      	   The Commission recommends that the government makes a declaration in terms of
                          article 34(6) of the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights on
                          the Establishment of the African Court on Human and Peoples’ Rights thus allowing
                          individual victims of human rights violations who have exhausted local remedies to
                          directly access the African Court.
                      	   The Commission recommends that the Ministry of Justice fast-tracks the expansion of
                          the national legal aid scheme to cover the entire country.




            Factors that Encouraged Perpetuation of Gross
            Violations of Human Rights
            35.	    The Commission finds that the following factors encouraged the perpetuation of
                    gross violations of human rights during the mandate period:

                     	   The failure of the first government in independent Kenya (led by President
                          Jomo Kenyatta) to dismantle the repressive state structures established by the
                          colonial government.

                     	   The use of and subsequent enhancement of repressive laws, policies and
                          practices initially employed by the colonial government by the first two post-
                          independence governments (President Jomo Kenyatta’s and President Daniel
                          Arap Moi’s administrations).

                     	   The creation of a de jure one party state by President Moi’s government,
                          resulting in severe repression of political dissent and intimidation and control
                          of the media. Repression of political speech and the media allowed many
                          violations to occur with little public scrutiny, much less accountability.

                     	   Consolidation of immense powers in the person of the President, coupled
                          with the deliberate erosion of the independence of both the Judiciary and
                          the Legislature.

                     	   The failure of the state to investigate and punish gross violations of human rights.
                          The Commission finds that in most cases, the state has covered-up or downplayed
                          violations committed against its own citizens, especially those committed by
                          state security agencies. During the entire mandate period (1963-2008), the state
                          demonstrated no genuine commitment to investigate and punish atrocities and
                          violations committed by its agents against innocent citizens.

Findings and Recommendations on Specific
Violations and Injustices
Colonial Era
36.	   The Commission finds that in order to establish and consolidate its rule in Kenya, the
       British government employed violence on a locally unprecedented scale. To force the
       local population into submission, the colonial administration in Kenya conducted
       punitive expeditions in the 1890 and 1920 against what they called ‘recalcitrant tribes’.
       There were military expeditions against the Nandi in 1901, 1905 and 1906, against
       the Embu in 1905, against the Kisii in 1904, 1908 and 1914, against the Kipsigis in
       1905 and against the Abagishu and Kabras in 1907. These military expeditions were
       characterised by massacres, torture, sexual violence, and destruction of property.

37.	   The British administration divided Kenyan territory into provinces and districts.
       These administrative boundaries were based on ethnic and linguistic units, in
       effect freezing cultural development and population mobility. The boundaries were
       arbitrary, in some cases dividing groups more sharply than had been the case and
       in some cases combining groups that were originally distinct. The Commission finds
       that the creation of these administrative units planted the seeds of ethnic hatred as
       communities started to establish ownership of their territories to the exclusion of
       others.

38.	   In certain cases, the British established its authority by establishing alliances with local
       leaders. These alliances were created through manipulation and, at times, through
       the circumventing existing indigenous systems of authority. The British manipulated
       leaders of the Maasai and Luhya (Mumia in Wanga and Sudi Namachanja in Bukusu).
       The British alo imposed leaders on local populations as was the case of Karuri wa
       Gakure and Kinyanjui wa Gathirimu among the Kikuyu. Manipulations were more
       evident in the signing of treaties involving British administrators and African leaders
       such as the Anglo-Maasai treaties of 1904 and 1911.

39.	   After violently bringing the local population into some form of submission, the
       Colonial administration proceeded to find means of making the colonial territory
       self-financing. This was achieved through the creation of the chief as agents of
       local administration who were tasked with the responsibility of tax collection,
       maintenance of law and order and mobilization of labour for settler requirements.
       Chiefs were empowered by a series of labour laws to call out any number of able-
       bodied persons to labour without pay. This mandate was extended at the outbreak
       of World War 1 to finding able-bodied manpower for the war. Chiefs had retainers
       who in the process of tax collection, confiscated peoples’ animals and produce,


                               REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION                       11
Volume IV   Chapter ONE




                    seized their women and routinely whipped men. The Commission finds that
                    such coercive authority, supervised and approved by the colonial administration,
                    explains the intense hatred for chiefs and the provincial administration in general,
                    even in the post-colonial period.

            40.	    Colonial violence reached its zenith in the 1950s (and mainly during the emergency
                    years), a time when communities in Kenya staged a fight for political and economic
                    self-determination. The British interned thousands of Africans in detention camps
                    set up around the country. The treatment at these camps was brutal. Information
                    about what happened at the camps was carefully controlled and the British colonial
                    office consistently denied reports of torture and other gross violations of human
                    rights.

            41.	    Although the British administration was responsible for atrocities during the
                    emergency years, the Mau Mau also committed atrocities against those they
                    perceived as local beneficiaries of colonial power, in effect turning neighbours and
                    relatives against each other. Contrary to African customs and values, the Mau Mau
                    assaulted old people, women and children.


            Shifta War
            42.	    The Commission finds that the Kenyan military inflicted violations and atrocities
                    on innocent civilians during the conflict. In particular, the Commission finds that
                    the Kenyan Army committed mass killings of civilians during the Shifta War and
                    that the number of people who were killed during the War is possibly much higher
                    than the official figure of 2000. Most of the killings took place in villages but the
                    Commission also received evidence showing that killings took place in places of
                    worship.

            43.	 The Commission finds that violations against women were widespread and
                 systematic. These violations included rape and other forms of sexual violence. The
                 Commission received evidence that women were held as sexual slaves by members
                 of the Kenyan Army. The Commission rejects the prevailing official view that sexual
                 violence during the Shifta War was infrequent and isolated.

            44.	    The Commission finds that the Kenyan Army was responsible for the killings
                    and large-scale confiscation of livestock belonging to civilians. The shooting
                    of especially camels was a particular strategy employed by the Army as it was
                    believed that camels were used by the Shifta to transport guns and other supplies.
                    The Army was responsible for the poisoning of livestock. Testimony received by

       the Commission reveal that it was common for soldiers and government officers to
       invade villages and confiscate cattle, sheep, camels and goats. The owners of such
       livestock were never told what happened to their livestock. Nor were they ever
       compensated for their losses.

45.	   The Commission finds that as part of the Shifta War, the Kenyan government
       established restricted or protected villages or camps in which residents of Northern
       Kenya were essentially detained and their movement severely restricted. This
       villagisation programme was eerily reminiscent of the detention camps created
       during the colonial period. The conditions in the restricted villages in Northern Kenya
       were squalid. Accounts received by the Commission indicate that diseases such as
       dysentery, pneumonia, malaria and tuberculosis were common in the villages
                                                                                                      We appeal for

                                                                                                      the revealing

47.	   The Commission finds that while those fighting against the Kenyan government                    Declaration
       committed violations against the local civilian population, the vast majority of              between Kenya
       violations were committed by the Kenyan government through its military and                     and Somali
       police officers and provincial administrators
                                                                                                      governments

       with little if any regard to the basic rights of the Kenyan citizens in the region.            which could

     concerted effort to cover up abuses committed in connection with the conflict,
     and enacted the Indemnity Act in order to protect government officials for
     accountability for wrongful acts committed in the conflict.

52.	   The Commission finds that the Indemnity Act not only covered up human rights
       abuses and other violations of both Kenyan and International Law, but itself is a
       violation of international law as it denies the victims of the conflict access to truth,

                    reparations, and accountability for what they suffered. The effects of the Indemnity
                    Act, the amount of time that has passed since the atrocities occurred, and fading
                    memories of victims and other witnesses to such atrocities, all contribute to
                    making it difficult to identify individual combatants who committed violations of
                    the Geneva Conventions and other applicable bodies of law.

            53.	    The Commission finds that Brigadier Joseph Ndolo and Brigadier Jackson Mulinge
                    (as they were then) bear command responsibility for the atrocities committed
                    against civilians by the Kenyan Army during the Shifta War.




                   Recommendations
                      	   The Commission recommends that the President, as the Commander-in-Chief
                          of the Armed Forces, within twelve months of publication of this Report,
                          acknowledges that the military committed atrocities during the Shifta War and
                          offer a public and unconditional apology to the people of North Eastern and all
                          who were affected by the conflict.
                      	   The Commission recommends the repeal of the Indemnity Act within nine
                          months of the issuance of this Report. If the Indemnity Act is not repealed
                          within the stipulated time, the Attorney General shall immediately thereafter
                          (and no later than one month after such six month period) issue a public report
                          explaining why the Indemnity Act has not been repealed and what steps, if any,
                          the government plans to take to ensure its repeal and to provide accountability
                          for the violations committed during the Shifta War.
                      	   The Commission recommends that within nine months of the publication of
                          this Report, the government, and particularly the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,
                          publishes the entire Memorandum of Agreement (Arusha Agreement) signed
                          between the Kenyan and Somalia governments and which marked the formal
                          end of the Shifta War. The Agreement should be published in at least three local
                          newspapers with wide circulation. Moreover, copies of this Agreement should
                          be translated into local languages spoken in Northern Kenya and be widely
                          disseminated in the region.
                      	   The Commission recommends the establishment of a public memorial to
                          commemorate the victims of Shifta War. The memorial should be established
                          within 24 months of the issuance of this Report.




14          REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION
                                                                                 Vol u m e IV   Chapter ONE




Massacres
Primary findings
54.	   Massacres have occurred throughout the history of Kenya. While they increased
       during and as a result of colonialism, massacres predate the colonial period. The
       Commission has documented the following massacres which occurred during the
       colonial period:
        	Kedong    Massacre
        	Massacres   committed in the context of the Giriama Rebellion
        	Kollowa   Massacre
        	Massacres  committed in the context of Mau Mau War including Lari Massacre
           and Hola Massacre

55.	   The Commission finds that most massacres committed by state security agents
       in the post-independence period have occurred in Northern Kenya, that is, North
       Eastern, Upper Eastern and North Rift. These massacres were committed during
       security operations with the stated purpose of, among other things, combatting
       cattle rustling and disarming the population. The Commission finds that state
       security agencies were responsible for the following massacres: Massacres during
       the Shifta War; Bulla Karatasi Massacre, 1980; Wagalla Massacre, 1984; Lotirir
       Massacre; and Malka Mari Massacre.

56.	   Massacres committed by civilians mostly occurred as a result of cattle rustling and
       inter-ethnic or inter-communal conflict. The Commission finds that the motivation
       for inter-ethnic massacres was mostly contestations for control of land for pasture
       and water. Another motivation includes retaliation. As such, ethnic groups which
       were victims of massacres were often previously perpetrators of massacres
       themselves against the attacking group. Inter-ethnic conflict was characterised by
       reprisals and revenge attacks.

57.	 Most accounts of massacres that were presented to the Commission were
     undocumented which made investigating such incidents difficult if not impossible.
     The vast majority of perpetrators responsible for the massacres have not had to
     answer for their crimes. To this day they remain unpunished.

58.	   Massacres that took place during the mandate period were invariably accompanied
       by the committal of a range of other violations. These included rape and other




                            REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION                  15
Volume IV   Chapter ONE




                    gender-based violations, torture, enforced disappearances and destruction of
                    property.

            59.	    The Commission finds that because most massacres committed by security agents
                    have occurred in Northern Kenya, victims of massacres are therefore predominantly
                    of Somali, Borana, Sakuye, Gabbra, Pokot and Turkana ethnic groups. Most victims
                    of massacres in North Eastern and Upper Eastern were predominantly Muslims.

            60.	    The communities targeted for attack by way of massacres in inter-ethnic conflict
                    were in most cases isolated and far from police or government presence. Victims
                    were mostly attacked or ambushed at watering points, while herding livestock or
                    while in their homesteads.

            61.	    Children were sometimes the targets of massacres. In the case of the Turbi Massacre
                    of 2005 a primary school was specifically singled out for attack and 21 children
                    killed. Similarly in the Murkutwa Massacre, a total of 12 children were killed.

            62.	    In respect of massacres committed by state security forces, the Commission finds
                    that these massacres were the products of a desire on the part of the relevant
                    security forces to impose collective punishment on communities whose members
                    were suspected of committing various transgressions.

            63.	    The Commission finds that the prevailing security environment of lax controls and
                    almost total impunity for perpetrators effectively encouraged and condoned the
                    committal of such heinous crimes.

            64.	    The Commission is not aware of a single criminal conviction for any massacre
                    committed by the security forces in Kenya during the mandate period.

            65.	    The Commission notes that command responsibility can be attributed to those
                    who exercise actual authority over subordinates. It applies to both civilian
                    and military officials. It arises when those in command knew, or had reason to
                    know, that crimes were about to be committed or had been committed by their
                    subordinates or those under their effective authority and control, and they failed
                    to take the necessary and reasonable measures within their power to prevent or
                    punish those subordinates. Commanders are under an objective responsibility
                    to try to establish what their subordinates are doing and discipline them where
                    appropriate. Responsibility can even be imposed where the commander does
                    not take adequate steps to keep abreast of the criminal activities of his or her
                    subordinates.




16          REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION
                                                                                     Vol u m e IV   Chapter ONE




66.	   The Commission made formal requests to the Ministry of Defence for information
       in respect of the role of the Army in the Shifta War and other massacres but no
       response was received. The Commission finds it regrettable that the Ministry of
       Defence chose to ignore or refuse the request, and thus to act in clear violation of
       the provisions of the TJR Act. In so doing the Ministry of Defence has undermined
       Kenya’s truth and reconciliation process.

Bulla Karatasi/Garissa Gubai Massacre
67.	   The Commission finds that the security operation conducted in Garissa in November
       1980 resulted in the massacre of hundreds of civilians. Numerous other atrocities
       were committed by state security agents (the regular police, administration police,
       General Service Unit, and the Kenya Army), including torture, brutal beatings, rape
       and sexual violence, burning of houses and looting of property.

68.	   The Commission finds that the Bulla Karatasi Massacre, and the detention, torture,
       rape and sexual violation of women, burning of houses and the looting of property,
       was a systematic attack against a civilian population and thus qualifies as a crime
       against humanity.

69.	   The Commission finds that to cover up the massacre, security agents involved in
       the operation disposed of the bodies of those killed into the Tana River.

70.	   The Commission finds that collective punishment was a key component of the
       Bulla Karatasi security operation which resulted in the mass killings of civilians.
       Security agents operated on the presumption that the entire population of Garissa
       town and its environs was somehow responsible for the shooting of civil servants,
       the crime which prompted the mounting of the security operation. On this basis,
       all Somali male adults were rounded and detained at Garissa Primary School where
       they were screened, tortured and brutally beaten.

71.	   The Commission finds that the military participated in the Bulla Karatasi Massacre.
       The commander of the Kenya Army, amongst others, flew to Garissa the day after the
       operation on a fact-finding mission. It is difficult to see what would have necessitated
       a high ranking member of the Kenya Army to visit the site of the massacre other
       than some level of military involvement in the operation. The Commission therefore
       rejects the official position that the military did not participate in the operation.

72.	   The Commission finds that members of the North Eastern Provincial Security
       Committee (chaired by Benson Kaaria, the then Provincial Commissioner for




                             REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION                     17
Volume IV   Chapter ONE




                    North Eastern Province) and Garissa District Security Committee at the time of the
                    Bulla Karatasi operation bear responsibility for the massacre and other atrocities
                    committed during the security operation. The members of both the Provincial and
                    District Security Committees sat in the same emergency meeting at which the
                    security operation and the collective punishment of male adults of the Somali ethnic
                    community was authorised. The Commission also finds that the Minister for Internal
                    Security at the time of the security operation, Godfrey Gitahi Kariuki (popularly known
                    as G.G. Kariuki), bears responsibility for the operation and the ensuing atrocities.

            73.	    The Commission finds that the conduct of Benson Kaaria and G.G. Kariuki, both of
                    whom appeared before the Commission, is consistent with the official denials and
                    deflections that followed in the aftermath of the Bulla Karatasi Massacre. Before the
                    Commission, Benson Kaaria repeatedly asserted that the Bulla Karatasi operation did
                    not result in any deaths nor were any women raped or otherwise sexually violated.
                    Similarly, G.G. Kariuki denied knowledge of any deaths or rapes. The Commission
                    finds that members of the North Eastern Provincial Security Committee and the
                    Garissa District Security Committee and the Minister of Internal Security at the
                    time of the Bulla Karatasi Massacre are unfit to hold public office in Kenya’s new
                    constitutional order.

            74.	    The Commission finds that despite the numerous atrocities committed by security
                    agents during the Bulla Karatasi operation no one was ever identified as responsible
                    or held to account.

            Wagalla Massacre
            75.	    The Commission finds that the security operation conducted in Wagalla, Wajir,
                    in February 1984 resulted in the massacre of hundreds of civilians. Numerous
                    other atrocities were committed by state security agents including torture, brutal
                    beatings, rape and sexual violence, burning of houses and looting of property

            76.	    The Commission finds that the Wagalla Massacre, including the detention, torture
                    and killing of the male members of the Degodia tribe at the airstrip, and the rapes,
                    killing of livestock and burning of homes in the villages, was a systematic attack
                    against a civilian population and thus qualifies as a crime against humanity.

            77.	    The Commission was unable to determine the precise number of persons murdered
                    in this massacre but accepts that a large number died, possibly close to a thousand.
                    The official figure of 57 given by the state therefore grossly underestimates the
                    number of people who were killed at Wagalla and is an example of the generally




18          REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION
                                                                                    Vol u m e IV   Chapter ONE




       thoughtless manner in which the state has traditionally treated massacres
       committed by its own agents.

78.	   The District Security Committee (DSC) at Wajir authorized the security operation
       that resulted in the massacre. The plan involved confining people at the airstrip, a
       place not officially gazetted as a detention center.

79.	   The Provincial Security Committee (PSC) at Garissa had a role to play in the
       authorizing of the operation as is evidenced from the signal that was sent from
       the Garissa PSC to the Wajir DSC that called for the rounding up of persons and
       livestock and for them to be “treated mercilessly”. The Commission finds such
       language in official communications to be highly inappropriate and reckless. Such
       words stood as an effective license for subordinates to take the law into their own
       hands. The Commission finds the PSC and in particular, the author of the signal,
       Provincial Police Officer Aswani, to be responsible for encouraging the recipients
       of the instruction to act in a lawless manner.

80.	   The Kenya Army is held to be responsible for the actual execution of the massacre.
       The military as a matter of necessity must also have played a role in the planning of
       the operation.

81.	   The Commission is satisfied that the DSC, the PSC and the Kenya Intelligence
       Committee (KIC) knew or should have known that the security approach adopted
       would lead to gross violations of human rights, including the deaths of innocent
       individuals. None of the members of these bodies learnt any of the lessons from
       earlier massacres, such as the 1980 massacre in Garissa (Bulla Karatasi). Alternatively
       these persons chose to ignore such lessons.

82.	   There was a deliberate effort by the government to cover up the details and extent
       of the massacre.  The cover-up involved most if not all of those in positions of
       authority in Wajir, Garissa and Nairobi.

83.	   The Commission notes that members of the KIC visited Wajir the day preceding
       the Wagalla Massacre, during which visit they held a meeting with the District
       Security Committee. The Commission finds that members of the KIC deliberately
       mischaracterized to the Commission the nature of the KIC trip and withheld or
       concealed information concerning their knowledge and/ or involvement in the
       security operation. The Commission finds that while development may have been
       on the KIC’s agenda as alleged by such members, its primary mission was in fact to
       assess the state of security in the region. This much is apparent from the documents




                             REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION                    19
Volume IV   Chapter ONE




                    concerning the planning of the trip, as well as the documents prepared shortly after
                    the trip.  This conclusion is also confirmed by some of the witnesses who testified.

            84.	    The Commission notes with deep concern that notwithstanding their positions
                    and seniority, their specific brief in the area, the security briefings received, and
                    their knowledge of ongoing incidents and the declining security situation in Wajir,
                    that all of the KIC members interviewed or who appeared in the hearings denied
                    any knowledge of the plans to follow up or deal with the security situation. The
                    Commission finds that, in the circumstances described above, such denials are not
                    credible.

            85.	    The Commission accordingly finds that the KIC must have been apprised of the
                    plans for the pending security operation. In fact the Commission was told that
                    the security operation was planned by the National Security Council in Nairobi
                    in January 1984 which, if true, makes it extremely difficult to believe that the KIC
                    would not have been made aware of such plans in connection with their tour of
                    the area. One of the questions the Commission was unable to answer is why the
                    KIC members have chosen to feign total ignorance as to what measures were to be
                    taken, even close to thirty years after the event.

            86.	    The KIC members were likely to have received news of the massacre before most
                    people. However they deny this. Some of them went so far as to claim that they
                    only heard of the Wagalla Massacre through newspaper reports that surfaced
                    weeks afterwards. The Commission finds these claims implausible

            87.	    The conduct of the KIC members is consistent with the official wall of silence that
                    descended over the facts and details of the Wagalla Massacre. In feigning ignorance,
                    the KIC members have invited deep suspicion about answers to the most serious
                    questions as to their specific roles in the days preceding and just after the Wagalla
                    Massacre. The Commission finds the conduct of the KIC members unbecoming of
                    their high offices. Indeed the Commission finds that particularly because of their
                    continued cover up of the circumstances surrounding the massacre that none of
                    the individuals who were members of the KIC are fit to occupy any position of
                    responsibility in the new Kenyan constitutional order.

            88.	    The Government refused to make available to the Commission specific documents
                    related to its investigation of this and other massacres in clear violation of the TJR
                    Act. Specifically the Commission did not receive the full set of minutes of meetings
                    of the relevant PSC, DSC, and KIC meetings, and did not receive any minutes of the
                    NSC, despite repeated requests. This violation of the TJR Act has severely hindered

       the ability of the Commission to discover the entire truth and context of these and
       other violations.

Malka Mari Massacre
89.	   The Commission finds that the 1981 security operation in Malka Mari, Mandera,
       resulted in the massacre of hundreds of individuals. During the security operation,
       women were raped and were subsequently shunned in the community. Others
       suffered serious injuries, including the loss of limbs.

90.	   The Commission finds that the state has maintained an official silence over the
       massacre.

Turbi and Bubisa Massacres
91.	   The Turbi Massacre occurred on the morning of 12 January 2005 when raiders
       attacked Turbi village in Marsabit. Afterwards, nine people were killed in Bubisa in
       revenge for the killings in Turbi. This killing of nine people is commonly referred to
       as Bubisa Massacre.

92.	 The Commission finds that preceding the Turbi and Bubisa Massacres were
     numerous resource-based conflicts between the Borana and Gabbra communities.

93.	   The Commission finds that about 95 people were killed during the Turbi and Bubisa
       massacres, including 12 children who were killed at Turbi Primary School.

94.	   The Commission finds that the Turbi and Bubisa Massacres were both ethnic-based
       and politically motivated.

95.	   The Commission finds that the Turbi and Bubisa Massacres occurred partly as a
       result of the failure of the state to provide security for the people of Marsabit and
       particularly the victims and survivors of the massacres. While there were early
       warnings of looming violence in Marsabit, the government security apparatus
       failed to respond in good time.

96.	   The Commission finds that that the Turbi and Bubisa Massacres has had severe
       impact on the communities living in Marsabit, especially the Gabras and Boranas.

97.	   The Commission finds that no one was ever identified as responsible or held to
       account for the Turbi and Bubisa Massacres. A criminal trial was against 3 people
       allegedly responsible for the Bubisa Massacre but the case was later withdrawn.

            Lotirir Massacre
            98.	    The Commission finds that the security operation conducted in West Pokot District
                    between 22 February and 22 May 1984 by the Kenyan security agents (mainly the
                    Kenya Army) resulted in what is popularly referred to as Lotirir Massacres.

            99.	    The security operation also resulted numerous other gross violations of human
                    rights, including torture, and sexual violence. The security agents used heavy
                    artillery and bombed the following areas in West Pokot District: Kadam Hill;
                    Achalau Hill; Lorusuk Hill; Kasei Hill; Chepyomot (Cheloboi arear); Tarakit Hill; Alale;
                    Nauyapong; and Kishiaunet. Moreover, the security agents confiscated or killed
                    livestock belonging to the local population.

            Murkutwa Massacre
            100.	 The Murkutwa Massacre took place on the morning of 12 March 2001 when heavily
                  armed Pokot raiders attacked residents of Murkutwa location in Marakwet District.

            101.	 The Commission finds that the Murkutwa Massacre occurred partly as a result of the
                  failure of the state to provide security for the people of Murkutwa and particularly
                  the victims and survivors of the massacre.

            Loteteleit Massacre
            102.	 Loteteleit Massacre occurred on 28 April 1988 when cattle raiders believed to be
                  the Toposa of Southern Sudan and the Nyangatom of Ethiopia ambushed the
                  Turkana at a water point at Loteteleit.

            103.	 The Commission finds that the Loteteleit Massacre occurred partly as a result of the
                  failure of the state to provide security for the people of Loteteleit and particularly
                  the victims and survivors of the massacre.




                              The President and the Prime Minister should admit
                            that atrocities like … wanton killings, rape, looting and
                          everything have happened and then they say, ‘we apologize
                            to the people of North Eastern Province (NEP)’. We can
                                                   accept that.

   Recommendations
        	   The Commission recommends that within six months of the issuance of this Report,
            the President formally apologizes for those massacres committed by government
            forces, and for the failure of the state to avert the massacres at Turbi and Bubisa
            despite having prior information of the same.
        	   The Commission recommends that the victims of the above-reference massacres
            be provided with reparations, both individual and collective, within 36 months of
            the issuance of this Report and consistent with the Reparations Framework of the
            Commission.
        	   The Commission recommends that all of the individuals identified in this Report as
            responsible for the planning, implementation, and cover up of the Bulla Karatasi and
            Wagalla Massacres – including but not limited to the then members of the DSC, PSC,
            and KIC – be barred from public office or any other position of public authority.
        	   The Commission recommends that within six months of the issuance of this
            Report, the Government shall release to the Implementation Committee all of the
            minutes of the relevant DSC, PSC, KIC, and NSC meetings with respect to each and
            every one of the massacres referred to above.
        	   The Commission recommends that the Government take into account the
            history of such massacres and other violations, including the related economic
            marginalization of the region, in formulating relevant development policies,
            including in prioritizing crucial infrastructure development. An explicit goal of such
            development policies must be addressing the historic economic marginalization
            of this and other similar areas.
        	   The Commission recommends that the Catholic Church facilitate the return of
            Father Adrian Joseph Janito to the country to testify about the massacre in Bubisa.




Political Assassinations
General findings
104.	 The Commission finds that during the mandate period, political assassination was
      one of the tactics used by the state and the political elite to repress dissent or
      eliminate political competition.

105.	 The Commission finds that political assassinations have exacerbated ethnic
      divisions and tensions. The assassination of Tom Mboya is a prime example of
      how assassinations can further divide communities and increase ethnic tensions.




                                REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION                        23
Volume IV   Chapter ONE




            106.	 The Commission finds that investigations into specific assassinations, when
                  undertaken, were usually deliberately shut down before conclusion. Even in
                  instances where such investigations had been concluded, their reports of findings
                  and recommendations were never publicized. The multiple investigations into the
                  assassination of Robert Ouko are an extreme example of this phenomenon, but it
                  is not the only example. The Commission finds that there is a lack of critical political
                  goodwill to conduct thorough and objective investigations into cases where the
                  victims are suspected to have been assassinated for political reasons.

            107.	 The Commission finds that the lack of a credible legal and institutional mechanism
                  for witness protection continues to hamper any objective inquiry into cases of
                  suspected political assassination. Witness intimidation and murder continue to
                  pose fundamental challenges to such inquiries. While there have been attempts
                  at fortifying legal and policy structures for witness protection, much more is
                  needed before credible and thorough investigations in such sensitive issues can
                  be undertaken.



            Specific findings
            Pio Gama Pinto
            108.	 The Commission finds that the assassination of Pio Gama Pinto was motivated
                  by ideological differences that were at the heart of the global Cold War but also
                  mirrored in domestic Kenyan politics.

            109.	 The Commission finds the conviction of Kisilu Mutua did little to clarify the
                  circumstances and motives behind Pinto’s assassination. The Commission agrees
                  with the finding of Justice Ainley that “the case wears an unfinished aspect and
                  that we may not have all who were involved in the crime before us.”

            110.	 The Commission finds that Kisilu, Chege Thuo and a third unidentified man who
                  disappeared, were used as scapegoats to divert attention away from the true
                  motive and the more responsible perpetrators of Pinto’s assassination.

            111.	 The Commission finds that there is sufficient circumstantial evidence, including
                  the failure by the government to uncover the truth of who was responsible, to
                  conclude that the government was involved in the killing of Pio Gama Pinto.

            Tom Mboya




24          REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION
                                                                                 Vol u m e IV   Chapter ONE




112.	 The Commission finds that Mboya was assassinated for his political beliefs, and the
      perception that he posed a threat to the political establishment.

113.	 The Commission did not receive any credible evidence refuting the involvement
      of Nahashon Isaac Njenga Njoroge in the assassination, but did receive sufficient
      evidence to find that Njoroge did not act alone.

114.	 The Commission finds that the circumstances surrounding Mboya’s assassination
      – including the political rivalries he provoked, and the failure of the government
      to investigate fully the assassination – point to the involvement of government
      officials in the killing and subsequent cover up.

JM Kariuki
115.	 The Commission finds that J.M. Kariuki was assassinated for political reasons. Based
      upon credible and direct evidence presented to the Commission, the Commission
      finds that state officials, including members of the police and the Special Branch,
      were directly involved in the assassination of Kariuki.

116.	 The Commission finds that there is sufficient evidence implicating the following
      individuals in the assassination and/or subsequent cover up: Peter Kinyuanji
      (aka Mark Twist); Pius Kibathi; Ben Gethi; Patrick Shaw; Waruhiu Itote; Ignatius
      Nderi; Arthur Wanyoike Thungu; John Mutung’u; Silas Mburu Gichua; and Mbiyu
      Koinange.

117.	 The Commission finds that there is sufficient evidence implicating the following
      individuals in the cover up of the assassination: Lee Kinyuanji; Bernard Hinga;
      James Mungai, Senior Administrative Commissioner of Police for Rift Valley; Thuo,
      District Commissioner of Nyandarua; Inspector Henry Waga; and Superintendent
      Kiarie.

118.	 The Commission finds that President Kenyatta deliberately interfered in the
      independent investigation undertaken by the Parliamentary Select Committee by,
      among other things, directly removing the following two names from the report
      because they worked in the Office of the President: Mbiyu Koinange and Arthur
      Wanyoike Thungu.

Robert Ouko

       Volume IV    Chapter ONE




                    119.	 The Commission finds that Robert Ouko was assassinated, and that there is sufficient
                          evidence to find that government officials were involved in his assassination and in
                          the subsequent cover up.

                    120.	 The Commission finds that government officials deliberately sabotaged every
                          attempt to investigate Dr. Ouko’s assassination, including the investigation
                          undertaken by Scotland Yard.

                    121.	 The Commission finds that the government never intended to support an
                          investigation that would unearth the truth of the assassination of Dr. Ouko.

                     122.	 The Commission finds that the multiple investigations into Dr. Ouko’s murder
                           have served to decrease clarity concerning the circumstances surrounding his

                           assassination of Dr. Mbai.

                    128.	 The Commission finds that the State is either unable or unwilling to engage in a
                          process that would shed light on the death of Dr. Mbai.

                                                                                          Vol u m e IV   Chapter ONE




Recommendations
          	 The Commission recommends that within six months of the issuance of this Report,
            all reports and materials of all previous investigations into these assassinations be
            made available to the public through the National Archives.
      	 The Commission recommends that within three months of the issuance of this
        Report the President shall publicly apologize to the families of those assassinated,
        and to the nation, for these assassinations and the failure of previous governments
        to investigate adequately such killings.
  	        With respect to the Ouko assassination, the Commission recommends that those
           individuals who have been identified by previous inquiries (including that of
           Troon, Gicheru, and Sungu) as individuals who should be further interviewed
           and investigated, and additional individuals identified in this Report linked to
           the assassination or its cover up, should in fact be interviewed and investigated,
           and the results of those investigations made public. These investigations and the
           submitting of a report setting out the result of such investigations to the public
           shall be finalized no later than eighteen months after the issuance of this Report.
  	        With respect to the Kariuki assassination, the Commission recommends that an
           investigation be commenced into the circumstances surrounding the assassination,
           paying particular attention to those individuals identified in the report of the
           Mwangale Committee and in this Report. At the conclusion of such investigation,
           any individuals for whom sufficient evidence exists shall be prosecuted, and a
           report will be issued setting out all of the information discovered through such
           investigation concerning the circumstances, motives, and those responsible for
           the assassination and subsequent cover up. Such report shall be made public no
           later than eighteen months after the issuance of this Report.
  	        With respect to the Mbai assassination, the Commission recommends that an
           investigation be commenced into the assassination and cover up, and that in
           particular such investigation include an investigation into Norman Nyaga. At the
           conclusion of such investigation, any individuals for whom sufficient evidence exists
           shall be prosecuted, and a report will be issued setting out all of the information
           discovered through such investigation concerning the circumstances, motives, and
           those responsible for the assassination and subsequent cover up. Such report shall
           be made public no later than eighteen months after the issuance of this Report.
      	    The Commission recommends that the government establish public memorials
           commemorating the lives Pio Gama Pinto, JM Kariuki, Robert Ouko, Father
           Antony Kaiser, and Crispin Odhiambo-Mabi and that such memorials include an
           educational component detailing the contributions such individuals made to the
           nation. Such memorials may include statues, museums, or educational institutions
           and shall be completed within 2 years of the issuance of this Report.
  	        The Commission recommends that an independent prosecutor be appointed to
           investigate and, if the evidence warrants prosecute, individuals linked to the death
           of Father Kaiser.




                               REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION                        27
Volume IV   Chapter ONE




            Extra-Judicial Killings and Enforced Disappearances
            129.	 The Commission finds that throughout the mandate period there was a common
                  trend pattern and state-sanctioned killings and disappearances. Indeed, the use
                  of excessive and disproportionate force by the police has been a common theme
                  running through Kenya’s history.

            130.	 The Commission finds that during the mandate period, it was common for the
                  state, and particularly the police, to summarily execute individuals who were
                  suspected to be criminals or members of proscribed criminal gangs.

            131.	 The Commission finds that excessive use of force by the police resulted in
                  significantly high numbers of death during, inter alia, the following contexts:
                  security operations; the official opening of the Nyanza General Hospital in Kisumu
                  in 1969; 1991 Saba Saba riots in1991; and 2007/2008 Post-Election Violence.

            132.	 The Commission finds that in the last half of 2007, state security agents, mainly the
                  Kenya Police, summarily executed and/or forcefully disappeared large numbers
                  of individuals suspected to be members of the outlawed Mungiki militia group.
                  The Commission finds that the killing and disappearance of suspected members
                  of Mungiki was a systematic attack against a civilian population and could thus
                  qualify as a crime against humanity.

            133.	 The Commission finds that in March 2008, as part of Operation Okoa Maisha,
                  state security agents, including Kenya Police and Kenya Army, were involved
                  in the summary execution and/or disappearance of suspected members of
                  Sabaot Land Defence Force (SLDF). The Commission finds that the killing and
                  disappearance of suspected members of SLDF was a systematic attack against a
                  civilian population and could thus qualify as a crime against humanity.

            134.	 The Commission finds that whenever the state has been faced with allegations
                  of extra-judicial killings and/or disappearances, its traditional response has been
                  to blatantly deny these allegations and attack the credibility and legitimacy of
                  those making the allegations, rather than investigate those allegations.

                                                                                           Vol u m e IV   Chapter ONE




   Recommendations
        	   The Commission recommends that the President and the respective heads of the
            Kenya Police and the Kenya Defence Forces, within six months of the issuance of this
            Report, offer a public and unconditional apology for extra-judicial killings committed
            during the mandate period.
        	   The Commission recommends the fast-tracking of reforms in the Police Service,
            including introduction of new standard operating procedures on the use of force.
        	   The Commission recommends that within two years of the issuance of this Report,
            the government ratifies the International Convention for the Protection of All
            Persons from Enforced Disappearance.
        	   The Commission recommends the establishment of a fully equipped national modern
            forensic laboratory within 36 months of the issuance of this Report, and thereafter in
            every county.
        	   The Commission notes that while Kenya is not an abolitionist state, it has not
            exercised the death penalty for close to three decades. The Commission recommends
            the abolition of the death penalty and the commuting all death sentences to life
            imprisonment or other appropriate sentence.
        	   The Commission recommends reparations for families of victims of extra-judicial
            killings in accordance with the Commission’s Reparation Framework.




Unlawful Detention, Torture and ill-Treatment
135.	 The Commission finds that the deliberate use of unlawful detention, torture and
      ill-treatment by security forces was encouraged and sanctioned by law in all three
      post-independence governments. Each of these successive political regimes failed
      to stop the practice, and failed to prosecute and punish the torturers. The use of
      torture as a government practice has its origins in the colonial period.

136.	 The Commission finds that both the colonial and post-independence state abused
      the provisions of states of emergency to sanction the use of unlawful detention
      and torture in quelling actual and perceived political opposition.

137.	 The Commission finds that systematic use of torture was employed by the Special
      Branch during interrogations of detained persons in Nyayo House, Nyati House,
      police stations, prisons, and other locations that victims were not able to identify.

138.	 The Commission finds that the practices of illegal detention and torture were used
      during joint security operations in Northern Kenya (North Eastern, Upper Eastern
      and North Rift), Likoni and Mount Elgon regions.



                                REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION                        29
Volume IV   Chapter ONE




            139.	 The Commission finds that the Nyayo House basement cells and the 24th, 25th and
                  26th floors were used for interrogations and torture after the attempted coup of
                  1982, during the Mwakenya crackdown, and the FERA/M crackdown, and further
                  finds that the state sanctioned the use of these places for torture purposes. The
                  Commission finds that the use of the Nyayo House basement cells as police cells was
                  never an afterthought but a well meditated plan by the government. The cells at the
                  basement of Nyayo House were designed and built specifically for torture purposes.
                  Indeed, the State established a task force for the specific purpose of interrogation
                  and torture of suspects.

            140.	 The Commission finds that during the crackdown on political dissent by the
                  government, torture was used to incriminate and incarcerate those who were
                  considered critical of the government and perceived as a threat to the security of
                  the regime. The Commission finds that the repression of political expression and
                  dissent has been a fundamental threat to the development of a meaningful culture
                  of democracy in Kenya.

            141.	 The Commission finds that the judiciary frequently cooperated with the prosecution
                  and security forces in the commitment of violations by refusing bail and by
                  admitting evidence obtained through torture. The judiciary was also complicit
                  in these violations by conducting trials beyond working hours, thus minimizing
                  transparency and public scrutiny.

            142.	 The Commission finds that torture and ill-treatment included the following:
                  detention in water-logged cells; being sprayed with hot and cold water; denial of
                  food, water and medical attention; beatings; humiliation; and the use of insects to
                  terrorize and attack detainees.

            143.	 The Commission finds that torture and ill-treatment by state operatives was often
                  extended to families of suspects and political activists.

            144.	 The Commission finds that victims of torture and their families suffered
                  psychologically, including through post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Direct
                  victims of torture have had their professional lives and livelihoods destroyed while
                  their families lived under great uncertainty and anxiety of not knowing the fate of
                  their loved ones, especially as to whether they were dead or alive.

            145.	 The Commission finds that unlawful detention in the form of prolonged pre-trial
                  detention is a continuing violation of human rights even up to today. Thousands of
                  inmates in Kenya are still awaiting an opportunity to defend themselves in court,
                  sometimes for years.

146.	 The Commission recognizes the role played by the media, civil society organizations
      and faith based organizations in advocating for respect for human rights and
      championing the release of political prisoners.



   Recommendations
        	   The Commission recommends the enactment of legislation prohibiting all forms of
            torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment
            committed both by state and non-state actors. Such legislation shall be enacted
            within one year of the issuance of this Report.
        	   The Commission recommends the establishment, through legislation, of the Office
            of the Independent Inspector of Prisons and All Places of Detention. This office shall
            be charged with the function of inspecting prison conditions and investigating
            allegations of torture and death in custody. The office shall issue periodic reports
            to the public on the condition of prisons in Kenya and other matters under its
            mandate.
        	   The Commission recommends the rapid, effective and transparent implementation
            of the proposed police reforms, including the introduction of new standard
            operating procedures on the use of force based on international standards. In
            particular, Force Standing Order 51, which allows the use of lethal force to protect
            property, should be repealed.
        	   The Commission recommends the prosecution of police officers and other
            state agents who were involved in the torture and ill-treatment of individuals
            during the mandate period. The Commission has identified individuals who
            were involved in the torture and ill-treatment of, amongst others, Mwakenya
            and FERA suspects and recommends their investigation and, where there is
            sufficient evidence, prosecution. In particular, the Commission recommends
            the prosecution of the following: James Opiyo; James Mathenge; Sam Chelimo;
            Munene Muhindi; John Mburu; SP Okwemba; Petkay Miriti; G Koskey; James
            Kilonzo; James Gachanja Kariuki; Christopher Karanja Kiarie; Noah Arap Too;
            Geoffrey Kinoti; Leonard Wachira; Elias Mjomba; Thomas Kiarie; Nyaga Wambora;
            and Benjamin Ogol.
        	   The Commission recommends that the President offer a public apology to all
            victims of torture and unlawful detention and acknowledge the role of the state in
            the design and use of the Nyayo House torture cells.
        	   The Commission recommends that Nyayo House be converted into a memorial
            after consultation with victims of torture.
        	   The Commission recommends the provision of reparation for victims of unlawful
            detention, torture and ill-treatment as per the framework described in the Chapter
            on Reparation Framework.

Volume IV   Chapter ONE




            Sexual Violence
            147.	 The Commission finds that sexual violence was committed throughout the
                  mandate period, and included gang rapes, sodomy, defilement, sexual slavery,
                  sexual assault and torture, and forced circumcision and other mutilation of sexual
                  organs. The Commission finds that cases of sexual violence increased during times
                  of conflict. The perpetrators took advantage of the breakdown of social order, the
                  increase in armed conflict, as well as general lawlessness to commit sexual violence
                  with impunity.

            148.	 The Commission further finds that, in most cases, victims were attacked on the
                  basis of ethnicity and assumed political affiliations. Many are said to have been
                  violated for belonging to ethnic groups alleged to have supported the ‘wrong’
                  political parties.

            149.	 The Commission finds that cases of sexual violence remain largely unreported with
                  victims citing reasons ranging from stigma; cultural taboos that prevent them from
                  talking about sex let alone sexual violation; harassment by hostile or disinterested
                  police officers; threats by the perpetrators; and lack of clear reporting lines, among
                  others. Where sexual violence had been committed by police officers, the victims
                  feared encountering their perpetrators at the police station and thus often did not
                  report the violation.

            150.	 The Commission finds that sexual violence took place in peoples’ homes, on the
                  roadside as victims tried to flee from violence, in places of confinement including
                  police stations and prisons, centres of interrogations, and IDP camps where victims
                  of displacement had sought refuge following the eruption of violence.

            151.	 The Commission finds that sexual violence against women was rampant during
                  forceful evictions conducted by the state and/or its agents. In one particular case,
                  the Commission received about 30 statements from women who were raped in
                  Kitui during an eviction referred to as ‘Kavamba operation’.

            152.	 The Commission finds that there is sufficient evidence implicating British soldiers
                  for the rape and sexual violation of women in Samburu and Laikipia between the
                  1980s to early 2000. In October 1997, for example, soldiers attached to the British
                  Regiment of Gurkhaswere stationed in Archers Post not only attacked and raped
                  about 30 women but also sodomised. As a result of the rapes, some Samburu or
                  Maasai women now have children of Gurkhas or British origin. These children now
                  face social stigma in the local community.

                                                                                   Vol u m e IV   Chapter ONE




153.	 The Commission finds that the Kenyan government has neither committed to
      nor shown any political will to investigate allegations of rape and sexual violence
      committed by British soldiers stationed in Kenya for military training.

Perpetrators
154.	 The Commission finds that perpetrators of sexual violence included state security
      agents, ordinary citizens, members of organised militia groups, as well as British
      soldiers stationed in Kenya for training purposes.

155.	 The Commission further finds that of all the cases of sexual violence committed
      during conflict, the majority of them were committed by state security agents,
      primarily by the General Service Unit (GSU), the Kenya Police, the Administration
      Police, the Anti Stock Theft Unit, as well as the Kenya military. The Commission
      further finds that state security-led interventions in situations of conflict were the
      single most important cause of sexual violations including gang rape and sexual
      torture. Security agents used sexual violence as a weapon to terrorise, suppress,
      intimidate and humiliate communities, and they not only actively committed
      atrocities of a sexual nature, but also failed in their duty to ensure the security and
      protection of citizens, particularly women and girls.

156.	 The Commission finds that despite evidence of sexual violence perpetrated by state
      security agents during security operations, there have been few if any investigations,
      much less prosecutions, of those responsible. The Commission further finds that
      in most cases, security agents colluded with each other in the commission of
      sexual violence as well as in frustrating any efforts to have fellow security agents
      investigated or prosecuted, thus breeding a culture of impunity.


Victims
157.	 The Commission finds that contrary to the traditional belief that women and girls
      are the sole victims of sexual violence, men and boys have also been targeted.
      Unfortunately, reporting on sexual violence against men has been low compared
      to that of women and girls. Further, persons with disability have also been
      targeted.

158.	 The Commission finds that victims of sexual violence range from the very young
      to the very old. The Commission finds that most victims of sexual violence also
      experienced other forms of violations including displacements, loss of family
      members, loss of property, and torture.

Volume IV   Chapter ONE




            Effects
            159.	 The Commission finds that other than physical and psychological trauma stemming
                  from being a victim of sexual violence, victims also suffered acute injuries; permanent
                  disabilities; contracting, and in some cases spreading, incurable diseases like HIV/
                  AIDs and Hepatitis B; ostracism; unwanted and unplanned pregnancies; miscarriages
                  and other health complications including incontinence, impotence and infertility;
                  abandonment by their spouses and parents; loss of abode and income; as well as
                  extreme feelings of humiliation and shame. In some cases, sexual violence resulted
                  in the death of the victims.

            160.	 The Commission further finds that not only the victims but also the children who
                  were born as a result of rape were equally shunned and suffered psychological
                  harm even though they were not the primary victims. The Commission further
                  finds that the situation is even worse for children of mixed race.

            Access to justice
            161.	 The Commission finds that despite Kenya ratifying many international human
                  rights instruments and having enacted various pieces of domestic legislation with
                  regard to sexual violence, the failure to implement fully such legislation has not
                  only left many Kenyans exposed to sexual violence but also denied the victims of
                  sexual violations access to justice.

            162.	 The Commission finds that the government response to sexual violence has been
                  wanting. While some victims tried to report sexual violence, their complaints were
                  either not recorded or not followed up for investigations. Victims complained of
                  being frustrated by the officers to whom they were supposed to report, who often
                  blamed the victims for the violations.

            163.	 The Commission further finds that the majority, if not all, of officers investigating
                  cases of sexual violence lack the prerequisite ability and knowledge of not only
                  preserving evidence but also successfully investigating and prosecuting cases
                  of sexual violence. As a result, very few reported cases have successfully been
                  prosecuted in court, thereby denying the victims an opportunity to achieve justice
                  for their violation.

            164.	 The Commission finds that the majority of victims of sexual violence cannot afford
                  legal services. Reported cases are thus rarely pursued through the legal system
                  as victims cannot afford legal representation. Although the government has
                  established a pilot national legal aid scheme, the Commission finds that it is still
                  limited in scope and capacity as it has only operated on a pilot basis. Victims also

                                                                                     Vol u m e IV   Chapter ONE




       expressed their lack of awareness of the legal process, while others complained
       of other obstacles such as long distances to the courts and the attendant cost of
       travelling there and perhaps having to spend a night away from home. Accordingly
       legal services are not widely and freely available across the country, thus negating
       the citizens’ constitutional right to access to justice.

165.	 The Commission further finds that the requirement of victims of sexual violence
      to obtain, from the police, the Kenya Police Medical Examinations Report Form 3
      (commonly known as P3 form), that is necessary for supporting medical evidence,
      has acted as a hindrance in their quest for justice. The Commission finds that
      although the form is required to be free, its unavailability in most police stations
      and the demand for a ‘photocopy fee’ of up to Ksh. 20 per sheet have discouraged
      many from obtaining it. The form’s availability on the police website has not helped
      to make it easily accessible, especially for victims from rural areas where electricity
      and internet services are not readily available. Even where it is possible to download
      the forms, victims are forced to pay for downloading and subsequent printing of
      the form. Further, the Commission finds that where victims managed to get a P3
      form and were attended to by a doctor, the doctor charged for the provision of that
      service. The fee was usually couched as facilitation for transportation to court to give
      expert testimony on the medical examination results. These requests for money are
      a further burden and cause for stress on already traumatised victims, and create
      barriers for many victims to access their constitutional right to justice.

166.	 The Commission also finds that in cases of sexual violence committed against
      children, parents, guardians and other authorities such as teachers are often willing
      to enter into agreements with the perpetrators to either ‘compensate’ the victim’s
      parents or, in the case of girls, marry them off to the perpetrator. Public officers such
      as chiefs are sometimes complicit in these acts of subverting justice for the victim.

Access to medical services
167.	 The Commission finds that the majority of victims of sexual violence were not able
      to obtain the crucial medical attention (PEP) that is required to be administered
      within 72 hours after the violation to prevent HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted
      infections as well as unwanted pregnancies. Even where the same was obtained,
      very few victims of sexual violence attended the required follow up medical check-
      up. The victims cited the following reasons: a breakdown in security and the fear
      of leaving home lest they expose themselves to further attacks; lack of transport;
      ignorance about PEP and not knowing that it is free and available in most public
      medical facilities; fear of being stigmatized if it were known they had been raped;
      and an overriding concern to protect, feed, and shelter their children and family

Volume IV   Chapter ONE




                    members at their own expense. As indicated elsewhere in this report, the majority
                    of victims of sexual violence had also suffered other violations, and for some of
                    them the provision of shelter and food was the biggest priority for them. For some,
                    medical services were a luxury. The result is that many victims died while others’
                    health deteriorated for lack of follow up medication.

            168.	 The Commission further finds that there are insufficient public medical facilities
                  countrywide with expertise and equipment to provide services to victims of sexual
                  and gender based violence.



                Recommendations
                      	   The Commission recommends that the President, within three months of the issuance
                          of this Report, acknowledges and offer a public and unconditional apology for acts of
                          sexual violence committed by state security agencies during security operations and
                          other periods of generalized violence such as the 2007/2008 Post-Election Violence.
                      	   The Commission recommends the establishment of a gender violence recovery
                          center in every county. Such a center shall serve as a one-stop centre for provision
                          of comprehensive services for victims and survivors of sexual violence including
                          medical and counseling services. Investigators trained in the investigation of sexual
                          violence should also be permanently stationed in such a center. In respect to this
                          recommendation, the governments may borrow good practices and lessons from
                          South Africa’s thuthuzela care centers and the Nairobi Women’s Hospital.
                      	   The Commission recommends the provision of reparation for victims and survivors of
                          sexual violence as per the Reparation Framework proposed by the Commission.
                      	   The Commission recommends the setting up of the Office of the Special Rapporteur
                          on Sexual Violence as recommended by the Commission of Inquiry into the Post-
                          Election Violence. This shall be done within 12 months of the issuance of this Report.
                      	   The Commission recommends that the National Police Service Commission formulates
                          a new Code of Conduct and Ethics for the National Police Service in line with the
                          Constitutional values and principles and spelling out disciplinary and accountability
                          measures for failure to adhere thereto.
                      	   The Commission recommends the prosecution of Nganda Nyenze who allegedly
                          planned, supervised or was otherwise involved in the Kavamba Operation in which
                          women were raped and/or sexually violated.
                      	   The Commission recommends that the British government apologizes for sexual
                          violence committed against women in Samburu and Laikipia by British soldiers.
                      	   The Commission recommends that the Kenyan Government considers entering into
                          negotiations with the British government with a view to seeking compensation for
                          victims of sexual violence committed by British soldiers in Samburu and Laikipia.

Women
169.	 The Commission finds that throughout the mandate period, women did not enjoy
      equal status with men. This is largely attributed to patriarchal customary norms
      and practices which relegated women to a subordinate status. These norms and
      practices, many of which still remain pervasive today, include disinheritance,
      preference for boys, polygamy, payment of dowry, cultural traditions relating to
      burial, early and forced marriages, chastisement of wives, female genital mutilation
      and widow inheritance. These norms and practices have, over the years, not
      only been entrenched but were also protected and permitted by legislation and
      sanctioned by the state itself.

170.	 The Commission finds that despite Kenya having ratified many international human
      rights instruments and having enacted various domestic laws that promote the
      rights of women, the existence of structural and systematic discrimination against
      women by the state itself prevented women from fully enjoying their rights. Some
      laws were manifestly discriminatory whereas others were discriminatory in their
      effects. Other laws such as the Judicature Act sanctioned customary practices
      which were manifestly discriminatory.

171.	 The Commission finds that although there have been deliberate constitutional,
      legislative and institutional reforms aimed at tackling gender discrimination in
      the country, thereby gradually advancing the rights of women in several spheres,
      women continue to be the subject of deeply rooted discriminatory norms and
      practices.

172.	 The Commission finds that violations of human rights have had greater consequences
      for the most vulnerable amongst women. These include: women with disabilities,
      women living with HIV/Aids, women in the rural areas and women from minority
      and indigenous communities. Moreover, economic marginalization of specific parts
      of the country has further marginalised women living in these regions.

173.	 The Commission finds that discriminatory cultural practices relating to access, use
      and ownership of land remain persistent despite legal provisions which guarantee
      everyone the right to property, whether they are female or male.

174.	 The Commission finds that although violence against women is prevalent during
      peacetime, it escalated during conflict and episodes of generalised violence,
      during which time women were specific targets of heinous crimes and violence
      including rape and sexual violence,.



                            REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION                  37
Volume IV   Chapter ONE




            175.	 The Commission finds that security operations conducted by state security agencies
                  have almost without exception often resulted in rape and other sexual violations.

            176.	 The Commission finds that violation of women’s reproductive health is widespread
                  and rampant. Many women are unable to access health facilities because of
                  poverty. In many parts of the country, health facilities are physically inaccessible
                  and women opt to give birth at home. The Commission further finds that the
                  delivery of health services around the county does not take into account local
                  cultural norms about health.

            177.	 The Commission finds that although awareness on the subject of HIV/AIDS has
                  permeated most parts of the country, discrimination and social stigma is still
                  relatively common. Many HIV positive women are routinely evicted from their
                  matrimonial homes after the death of their spouses. Moreover, patriarchal social
                  norms make it difficult for women to exercise autonomy over matters of sex, and
                  specifically, to negotiate safe sex.

            178.	 The Commission finds that although the government has taken positive steps to
                  address the nation’s HIV epidemic, the rights of women living with and affected
                  by HIV continue to be violated. These violations include: failure to seek informed
                  consent before HIV-testing; breach of confidentiality and lack of proper disclosure;
                  inadequate pre- and post-testing counseling; inadequate PMTCT and post-
                  partum counseling; lack of medical attention or inattentive medical staff; lack of
                  equipment, supplies, infrastructure, and hygienic conditions; and mistreatment
                  and harassment in seeking delivery of services.

            179.	 The Commission finds that although men were the predominant victims of
                  repressive and authoritarian means employed by the state, women were also
                  victims, both as primary and secondary victims. As primary victims, scores of
                  women, especially politicians, academics or human rights activists, and female
                  Members of Parliament who were vocal in their opposition to repressive rule in both
                  Kenyatta’s and Moi’s administrations, were often detained, tortured and subjected
                  to politically motivated charges. As secondary victims of state repression, many
                  women were widowed after their husbands were killed in security operations or
                  died in police custody after undergoing torture. Some were subsequently thrown
                  into destitution following the detention or death of their spouses.

            180.	 The Commission further finds that although men were the main active agents of
                  President Kenyatta’s and President Moi’s repressive governments, some women
                  were also involved in the perpetuation of gross violations of human rights.

                                                                                 Vol u m e IV   Chapter ONE




181.	 The Commission finds that women constitute the majority of the poor, a situation
      that has been aggravated by various factors that range from their lack of access to
      productive resources (mainly land) and the labour markets.

182.	 The Commission finds that discrimination against women in the workplace remains
      despite years of concerted efforts to ensure that men and women are treated
      equally. Women with disabilities particularly find it difficult to access employment
      opportunities.

183.	 The Commission finds that throughout the history of Kenya, women have had
      limited access to education opportunities. During the colonial period, when formal
      schooling was introduced, it is boys rather than girls who were encouraged to
      join. When girls were allowed to go to school, it was not without resistance from
      communities, which invariably perceived the new education offered by missionaries
      as informed by the bad intentions of ‘spoiling’ good girls. The education offered
      to girls by colonial schools and later by schools in independent Kenya was not
      completely progressive either. The syllabus was designed to nurture girls’ domestic
      roles as wives and mothers

184.	 The Commission further finds that although huge strides have been made towards
      promoting the education of the girl child, the rigidity of socially ascribed gender
      roles has seen girl child education interrupted by early marriage, female genital
      mutilation and other harmful cultural practices. In some areas, culture continues
      to dictate who, between the girl and the boy, should be given priority in accessing
      education. Further, in some areas, especially the arid and semi-arid regions of the
      country, girls’ education is routinely interrupted by constant migration of families
      in search of pasture and water. Insecurity and poverty are other factors that impede
      girls’ access to education. In addition, lack of sanitary towels has meant that girls
      periodically skip going to school during their menstrual flow. The Commission
      further finds that the situation is even worse for girls with disabilities.

185.	 The Commission also finds that girls’ and women’s limited access to education
      has strong and direct linkages with the multiple violations and abuses that they
      routinely suffer.

186.	 The Commission finds that although women are the majority of the population,
      they continue to be excluded in public spaces of influence and decision-making
      due to various factors, chief amongst which are cultural notions pertaining to
      the role and place of women and men in society. Discrimination against women
      and their exclusion in decision-making processes is also rampant and sanctioned

                    in religious institutions. Further, many women who aspire to be leaders lack the
                    requisite resources to undertake political campaigns and have also been subjected
                    to violence or threat of it.

            187.	 The Commission finds that the Mt. Elgon Conflict and the subsequent security
                  operation (Operation Okoa Operation) had a particularly devastating impact for
                  women. In this regard, a vivid impact of the conflict and Operation Okoa Maisha is
                  the huge numbers of widows (approximately more than 300) in Mt. Elgon whose
                  husbands were killed or forcefully disappeared during the conflict.

            188.	 A huge proportion of widows in Mt. Elgon witnessed the brutal and cruel killing by
                  SLDF or state security agents of their husbands, children and relatives. In certain
                  cases, the SLDF in particular forced wives to watch the killing of their husbands or
                  children.

            189.	 The Commission finds that rape and sexual violence against women was routinely
                  committed by SLDF members during attacks at homes and in their hideouts in
                  the forest. In many cases, these heinous acts were witnessed by family members,
                  including children. Moreover, sexual violence was often accompanied by other
                  forms of inhuman and degrading treatment.

            190.	 The majority of Mt. Elgon women were sexually violated by SLDF members.
                  However, state security agents – police and military officers – were also responsible
                  for sexual violence during the entire period of Operation Okoa Maisha.

            191.	 The Commission confirms the findings of the Commission of Inquiry into the Post
                  Election Violence (CIPEV) in respect of experiences of and violations suffered by
                  women during the 2007/2008 Post-Election Violence:

                     	   the Commission received evidence showing that female headed households
                          were particularly targeted for looting and torching;

                     	   Many women were raped and sexually violated during the PEV;

                     	   Women were disproportionately affected by the PEV, including the fact that
                          they constituted the largest percentage of internally displaced persons

            192.	 The Commission finds that the state’s response to the plight and needs of internally
                  displaced women generated by the 2007/2008 Post-Election Violence was less
                  than satisfactory. The resettlement programme, Operation Rudi Nyumbani, did not
                  cater for the particular needs or interests of women. A considerable number of

                                                                                          Vol u m e IV   Chapter ONE




      women received neither the start-up capital nor the payment in lieu of housing. In
      certain cases, women were discriminated against in the registration process.

193.	 The Commission finds that Kenyan refugee women in Uganda (as is the case
      with refugee men and children) experience discrimination on the basis of their
      nationality. Due to their inability to speak the local language, Kenyan refugees find
      it difficult to access public services, especially medical and health care services.

194.	 On the question of returning to Kenya, statistics availed to the Commission by the
      Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees revealed that the
      majority of Kenyan refugees (60 percent) were not willing to return to Kenya. The
      Commission’s visit and hearing at Kiryandongo Refugee Camp in Uganda revealed
      that many women have found themselves in a dilemma as to whether they should
      return or not. While some women were willing to return, their husbands were not. As
      such, these women could not return to Kenya without straining or breaking up their
      marriages.



   Recommendations
        	   The Commission recommends that the President, within six months of the issuance
            of this Report, offers a public and unconditional apology for states’ sanction of
            discrimination against women during the mandate period.
        	   The Commission recommends that the Gender and Equality Commission steps up
            measures to raise awareness about harmful cultural practices that adversely affect
            women’s enjoyment of human rights.
        	   The Commission recommends that the Attorney General and Parliament expedites
            the enactment of the following bills relating to women’s rights: Marriage Bill, 2007;
            Matrimonial Property Bill, 2007; Family Protection Bill, 2007; Equal Opportunities
            Bill, 2007
        	   The Commission recommends that within nine months of the issuance of this Report,
            the government, in conjunction with the UNHCR and the Uganda Government,
            conducts its own independent survey of the willingness of Kenyan Refugees in
            Uganda to return to Kenya and immediately facilitate the return and resettlement of
            those willing to return.
        	   The Commission recommends that within twelve months of the issuance of
            this Report, the government shall ensure that the composition of land dispute
            tribunals meets the Constitutional gender ratio requirement.
        	   The Commission recommends that within twelve months of the issuance of this
            Report, the Ministry of Health adopts a Plan of Action outlining measures to be taken
            to increase and improve maternal health facilities in the country and particularly to
            reduce the number of cases of delivery at home.



                               REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION                        41
Volume IV   Chapter ONE




            Children
            195.	 The Commission finds that during the mandate period, children were both direct
                  and indirect victims of gross violations of human rights. As direct victims, they
                  suffered atrocities including killing, maiming, torture and sexual violence. Children
                  also witnessed atrocities and as a result of which many of them remain traumatized.

            196.	 During the Mau Mau War, children were subjected to traumatic experiences; many
                  children witnessed the atrocious crimes committed against their parents and adults
                  in generally.

            197.	 The Commission finds that the Sabaot Land Defence Force and Mungiki militia
                  forcefully recruited children into their militia. Some of these children were
                  subsequently involved in atrocities.

            198.	 The Commission finds that with the introduction of free primary education in Kenya
                  in 2003, many children are now able to attend school. However, there still remain
                  real impediments that prevent children from accessing education, such as lack of
                  school uniforms and writing materials. Children with disabilities face particular
                  challenges in this regard. Institutions catering for the education of children with
                  disabilities are few and inadequately resourced.

            199.	 The Commission finds that there are still alarming rates of gender inequality in
                  some parts of the country where very few girls attend school. This inequality is
                  attributed to cultural beliefs and practices which privilege male children. Female
                  children are often forced to remain at home to carry out household chores and
                  other tasks. If they do attend school they are often unable to focus on schoolwork
                  due to responsibilities given to them at home. Finally, forced/early marriages and
                  pregnancies are also barriers to girls accessing education.

            200.	 The Commission finds that sexual violence against children is perpetrated by people
                  holding positions of authority or individuals who ought to protect them, such as
                  parents, family members, teachers, religious leaders and members of the police
                  and military. Due to the nature of the relationships in this setting, many of the cases
                  are unreported and victims experience the abuse repeatedly. Children have also
                  been sexually violated by their peers. There is also evidence that female relatives
                  perpetuate this vice either through complacency or even actively encouraging it.

            201.	 The Commission finds that sexual violence against children increasingly occurs in
                  environments that should be safe havens for them, such as homes and schools,
                  with homes being the most common. The Commission finds that violations against
                  children remain largely unreported.




42          REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION
                                                                                       Vol u m e IV   Chapter ONE




202.	 The Commission finds that despite the implementation of a number of programmes
      aimed at improving child health, infant and child mortality rates remain unacceptably
      high in Kenya, a situation that has been linked to factors such as economic status,
      infrastructural factors, the mother’s level of education; and health care and nutrition.
      The Commission further finds that even minimal fees payable at health care
      institutions are beyond the reach of a good number of families.

203.	 The Commission finds that child labour is an increasing problem, and is often the
      product of the vulnerable economic status of families. Children from indigent
      families are forced to fend for themselves and their families. HIV/AIDS infections
      and health crises in general have also increased the number of orphaned children
      and made them more vulnerable for child labour recruitment. Domestic violence
      also potentially increases the vulnerability of children to child labour. The absence
      or loss of parents often leads to children fending for themselves, leaving them
      susceptible to being exploited for labour.

204.	 The Commission finds that enforcing the law in cases of sexual exploitation is
      hampered by uncooperative relatives who opt to receive compensation instead of
      calling for the prosecution of the perpetrators.

205.	 Children experiencing violence at home sometimes opt to run away from home
      and end up as street children.

206.	 Children have traditionally constituted a huge proportion of displaced persons, a
      situation that has exposed children to extremely harsh conditions which negatively
      interfere with their enjoyment of other rights including access to education, health
      care, decent shelter, adequate food and other basic human needs

207.	 The Commission finds that the majority of Kenyan refugee children and youth
      living in Kiryandongo, Uganda, are willing to return to Kenya but are unable to do
      so because their fate is tied to that of their parents or guardians.

208.	 The Commission finds that whereas there have been attempts by the Government to
      establish institutions crucial to the protection and enforcement of children’s rights,
      such institutions remain understaffed and do not have adequate resources. Where
      staff exists, they either lack proper training on children’s rights or are stationed at the
      district level, and as a consequence the majority of children are not reached.

209.	 Non-state actors such as non-governmental organisations (NGOs) have stepped
      in and played a key role in the promotion and protection of children’s rights in a
      variety of different ways including investigating and reporting about the abuses




                              REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION                      43

                    committed against children; creating public awareness about the rights of children
                    and promoting social change against practices that are not compatible with the
                    realisation of these rights; providing technical assistance by training stakeholders
                    who are directly involved in matters of children’s rights, such as the police as well
                    as providing financial assistance to key government departments. Their presence
                    within communities has provided practical solutions preventing or dealing with
                    violations of children’s rights. In spite of their immense contribution in promoting
                    and ensuring the realisation of children’s rights, some non-state actors, especially
                    some children’s homes, have been accused of violating these rights.



                Recommendations
                      	   The Commission recommends that the President, within six months of the issuance of
                          this Report apologizes for atrocities committed against children during the mandate
                          period.
                      	   The Commission recommends that psychosocial and counseling services be
                          provided to children victims of gross violations of human rights and injustices.
                      	   The Commission recommends that reparation be provided to children victims of
                          gross violations of human rights and injustices in accordance with the Commission’s
                          Reparation Framework.
                      	   The Commission recommends that Borstal institutions be placed under the
                          Department of Children’s Services in the Ministry of Gender, Children and Social
                          Development as opposed to the Prisons Department in the Ministry of Home
                          Affairs. These institutions should be removed from prisons’ premises and should
                          be run by children officers trained in counseling and psychology.
                      	   The Commission recommends that children’s desks at police stations be well
                          funded and in the meantime only officers who have been trained on child rights
                          should deal with children. Gradually all officers should be trained on child rights
                          and child sensitive procedures.
                      	   The Commission recommends that more remand homes be established to avoid
                          placing of alleged juvenile delinquents in police cells and prisons.
                      	   The Commission recommends that restorative justice mechanisms be formally
                          introduced in the juvenile justice system and police officers should be sensitized
                          and trained on how to set these in motion. Structures should be established to
                          incorporate different players such as children’s officers and community workers.
                      	   The Commission recommends that the Department of Children’s Services be well
                          funded to adequately respond to violations of child rights. More offices should be
                          established to enhance accessibility to children’s officers. The role and availability
                          of children’s officers should be publicized for their services to be sought.
                      	   Although court procedures to enforce parental responsibility are user friendly,
                          there is need to provide more assistance to parties who cannot afford lawyers as

            well as illiterate parties. It is acknowledged that judicial officers are proactive in
            this but there is need for formal mechanisms to ensure that needy parties are able
            to obtain justice.
        	   Children are subjected to harm and danger where institutions fail to provide safe
            custody. Adequate security must be provided in institutions such as schools which
            have children in their custody. Guidelines should be developed on the minimum
            security requirements for such institutions.
        	   Institutions that are mandated to have children in their custody must be regularly
            and closely monitored to ensure that child rights are not violated.
        	   While primary education is free, many children are still unable to enjoy the right
            to education due to various factors including lack of necessary amenities such
            as school uniform and writing materials. The Commission recommends that a
            scheme be established to provide further financial support to indigent children to
            enable them acquire these necessary amenities.
        	   In some marginalized areas, the schools are few and are inaccessible to children
            living far from where they are located. The Commission recommends that more
            schools be constructed and a policy be developed as to the minimum standards
            on the number of schools serving a given area.
        	   The Commission recommends that the Ministry of Education work towards the
            progressive integration of children with disabilities in the mainstream educational
            facilities by tailoring these facilities to suit the specific needs of children with
            disabilities. In this regard, the Ministry of Education should within one year
            formulate a Plan of Action outlining modalities for progressive integration of
            children with disabilities in mainstream educational facilities.




Minority Groups and Indigenous People
210.	 The Commission finds that throughout the mandate period the state failed to
      recognize the existence, unique culture and contributions of many minority and
      indigenous communities in Kenya.

211.	 The Commission finds that over a period of decades the state discriminated against
      minority and indigenous communities, specifically those residing in North Eastern,
      Upper Eastern, Rift Valley and Coast provinces, through emergency laws and
      regulations that violated their rights to equality before the law and due process of law.

212.	 The Commission finds that the state discriminated against the Nubian, Somali,
      Galjeel and other Muslim communities in Kenya through legislation and regulations
      on citizenship that has denied them equality before the law.

                    213.	 The state failed in its responsibility to protect communities in predominantly pastoralist
                          areas from inter-communal violence. This failure has resulted in thousands of deaths,
                          injuries, forced displacement, sexual violence, loss of property and destruction of
                          entire homesteads and villages over a period of more than 40 years.

Recommendations
 	   The Commission recommends that within two years of the issuance of this
     Report, the government ratifies the following international and regional
     instruments: ILO Convention 169; Convention on the Prevention and
     Punishment of the Crime of Genocide; Convention on the Protection of the
     Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families; Convention
     Against Discrimination in Education; and Statelessness Conventions.
	    The Commission recommends that the President, within six months of the
     issuance of this Report, issues an official, public and unconditional apology
     to minority and indigenous communities in Kenya for the state’s systematic
     discrimination against these groups and communities during the mandate
     period.
	    The Commission recommends that obstacles experienced by minority groups
     such as members of Somali and Nubian ethnic communities in accessing the
     national identity cards be removed within 12 months of issuance of this Report.
	    The Commission recommends that the Kenya Law Reform Commission
     examines all Kenyan legislation to ensure that it does not result in de jure or de
     facto discrimination against minority groups. In consultation with minority and
     indigenous groups, develop national legislation governing state-sponsored or
     private development programs that requires free-prior and informed consent
     of affected communities and that includes specific guidelines as to how to
     engage in a process of consultation with communities.
	    The Commission recommends that the government develops a plan on data
     collection and disaggregation on minority and indigenous communities,
     with special attention to ensuring disaggregation of data related to minority
     and indigenous women. The process shall incorporate the principles of the
     United Nations Expert Workshop on Data Collection and Disaggregation for
     Indigenous Peoples.
	    The Commission recommends the release and implementation by the
     Government of the recommendations of the Presidential Special Action
     Committee to Address Specific Concerns of the Muslim Community in Regard
     to Alleged Harassment and/or Discrimination in the Application/Enforcement
     of the Law. The recommendations of the Special Action Committee related to
     the following seven areas: citizenship and registration of persons; security;
     access to and administration of justice; lands; education; representation and
     participation; and development and investment.

            Economic Marginalization and Violation of Socio-
            Economic Rights
            Primary findings

            222.	 The Commission finds perceptions of economic marginalization are deeply held
                  in North Eastern and Upper Eastern, Coast, Nyanza, Western and North Rift. The
                  Commission finds that economic and other policies adopted by the state during
                  the mandate period resulted in the economic marginalization of these five regions.

            223.	 In certain regions, there exist intra-regional narratives of marginalisation that are
                  blamed on regional and local rather than national forces.

                     	   In Central Province, residents of Nyandarua, where the assassinated leader JM
                          Kariuki hailed from, considered themselves marginalised by others within the
                          region.

                     	   Residents of Kuria see their counterparts in the broader region as somewhat
                          advantaged vis-a-vis themselves and that they (Luo and Kisii) are in some way
                          part responsible for their situation.

                     	   In Western Province, a region that appears to share Nyanza’s political and
                          economic fortunes, narratives of marginalisation are not uniform. Evidence
                          shows that certain parts of Western that have been close to power, in particular
                          Bungoma and Vihiga appear to be the main beneficiaries of the limited social
                          goods due to co-option, at least under President’s Moi administration.

                     	   In North Eastern and Upper Eastern, sub-regional claims of marginalisation
                          invariably assume an ethnic or clan flavour. For instance, the Commission
                          recorded testimony from members of the Ajuran clan who see themselves
                          as victims of the Degodia clan, and with complicity from the Provincial
                          Administration and central government.

            224.	 The Commission finds that residents of regions that were not identified as
                  economically marginalized also consider themselves to have been marginalised at
                  one point or another in history. The Commission acknowledges and affirms these
                  perceptions.

                     	   In the case of Central Province, testimonies were received to the effect that
                          the region’s fortunes dwindled under President Moi, with social infrastructure
                          being degraded and the vast majority of elites excluded at the top, at least
                          after the 1982 coup attempt.

                                                                                   Vol u m e IV   Chapter ONE




       	   Residents of Rift Valley see themselves as the main ‘victims’ of marginalisation
            under the Kibaki administration, at least as far as appointments to key positions
            in the public service are concerned

225.	 The Commission finds that while Lower Eastern is often not regarded as a
      marginalised region, at least not in popular narratives, this silence obscures
      shocking levels of poverty and lack of social facilities in parts of this region.
      Cases of drought, famine and starvation in parts of Ukambani have become a
      staple of national news and shame. This state of affairs is in part due to policies
      of marginalisation by President Kenyatta’s and President Moi’s administrations.
      Other than the harsh climatic conditions, the failure by successive regimes to
      take measures to arrest the perennial food insecurity situation and enhance
      access to basic goods such as potable drinking water must be acknowledged as
      a key factor

Context of economic marginalization
226.	 The Commission finds that economic marginalisation experienced by various
      regions, groups and communities in Kenya since independence has occurred
      in a historical, socio-economic and political context marked by certain factors.
      These include: an overly centralised state both in terms of power and resources;
      ethnicisation of politics and public life in general; an all-powerful ‘imperial’
      presidency marked by lack of accountability, lack of judicial independence, weak
      rule of law and personalization of power; bad governance and rampant corruption;
      a stunted economy in which the state was the main dispenser of largesse; and
      conflicts revolving around land with large swathes of the population unable to
      access this important resource. All these evolved against a backdrop of historical
      irredentist/secessionist struggles marked by the ‘Shifta War’ and its aftermath
      in Northern Kenya as well as independence claims borne out of perceived
      marginalisation in the former Coast Province. While some of these factors were the
      root cause of marginalisation, they produced distortions that worsened the effects
      of economic marginalization

227.	 The Commission finds that the seeds of inequality and marginalisation were planted
      by the colonial administration. The practices of the colonial administration, mostly
      through its ‘divide and rule’ strategy planted the seeds of inter-ethnic rancour, but
      also set off a process that would produce economic marginalization.

228.	 The failure of subsequent governments (in particular the Kenyatta government), to
      correct this injustice by restoring communities to their lands from which they had
      been forcibly evicted by the colonial government can be said to be largely to blame



                             REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION                   49
Volume IV   Chapter ONE




                    for inequities in land ownership and access in many parts of Kenya (especially in
                    Central, Rift Valley, Western and Coast provinces).

            229.	 While post-independence governments have had a role in skewing economic
                  empowerment in favour of certain ethnic communities, certain communities – in
                  particular sections of the Kikuyu community – got a head start by virtue of their
                  proximity to centers of settler economy

            230.	 The Commission finds that there is a perception, at least among residents of the former
                  Northern Frontier District, that the claims of secession by a group of Somalis explains,
                  at least in part, how the region and its residents have been treated by successive
                  government over the years. Residents of this region complain of discriminatory
                  laws, regulations, practices and procedures that apply to them only and not to other
                  Kenyans. This is especially so in the area of citizenship and immigration laws

            Role of the state in economic marginalization
            231.	 The Commission finds that the seeds of economic marginalisation of certain
                  regions were planted by the first formal economic blueprint, Sessional Paper No.
                  10 titled ‘African Socialism and its Application to Planning in Kenya’ published in
                  1965. Although this Policy was imbued with values of inclusion, human dignity,
                  brotherhood and social justice and could have anchored equitable development,
                  certain aspects of the policy, in particular its implementation, carried the seeds of
                  inequality and economic marginalisation that would characterize the Kenyan state
                  in succeeding years.

                     	   the policy justified prioritization of investment in certain regions to the
                          exclusion of others

                     	   the economic policy took a decidedly capitalist slant, with a limited welfare
                          component.

                     	   although the Policy recognized that land was previously owned communally
                          with access regulated through membership in a particular group (clan or ethnic
                          group), it asserted that a system of secure private title to land was necessary to
                          anchor economic growth. Yet, the diversity of claims (that included communal
                          title that governed property in most communities in the pre-colonial era) as well
                          as the effects of dispossession during the colonial period was not taken into
                          account.

            232.	 The restructuring of the state by the Kenyatta government soon after independence
                  did not match, and in fact undermined the vision articulated in the economic

                                                                                 Vol u m e IV   Chapter ONE




      policy based on African Socialism. The systematic dismantling of the independence
      constitution (abolishing of regional governments, the strengthening of the
      presidency while emasculating parliament and the judiciary) was inimical to the
      stated goals of African Socialism that underpinned economic policy

Economic Marginalization of North Eastern
233.	 The marginalisation of the North Eastern region is marked by four key
      developments: the carving off of the Northern Frontier District; the
      enactment and application of separate laws to the region; the Shifta
      War (1963 to 1967) waged by separatist ethnic Somali forces and; the
      application of discriminatory development policies by post-independence
      governments. The marginalisation of the communities in the former NFD, who
      are largely pastoralists, goes back to the colonial era

234.	 The Commission finds that there is a clear link between the government’s policy
      of viewing every issue in the North from a security perspective and the economic
      marginalisation suffered by the region. Many residents attribute the marginalisation
      the region suffered in subsequent years to the fact that they had expressed an
      affirmative voice in favour of secession from Kenya that was brutally muzzled

235.	 The state has also been directly responsible for economic marginalisation as a
      result of deprivations visited on residents because of policies aimed at enhancing
      security. In particular the numerous security operations conducted in this region
      have often resulted in loss and confiscation of property, especially cattle, by state
      security agents.

236.	 Difficulties encountered by residents of this region in having their citizenship
      recognised, including acquiring identity documents and passports goes to
      the core of the economic marginalisation that they have experienced. Without
      citizenship, the people could not claim their rights. They became vulnerable to
      abuse. The Commission heard many heart-wrenching stories about lives that have
      been destroyed for lack of national identity cards and by extension passports

Economic marginalization of Nyanza
237.	 The disintegration of the Kikuyu-Luo coalition that formed the core of KANU at
      independence and the eventual fallout between Kenya’s first President Jomo
      Kenyatta and first Vice-President Oginga Odinga in 1966 over differing visions
      for the country as described earlier forms an important context within which to
      contemplate the marginalisation of Nyanza




                            REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION                  51
Volume IV   Chapter ONE




            238.	 The Commission takes the view that while Luo personalities served in President
                  Moi’s administration, the co-option of these elites did not necessarily translate into
                  economic inclusion in a broad sense. The inclusion of certain elites in government
                  also had a political goal under the first two post-independence administrations:
                  it served to politically isolate Odinga who had taken a hard-line stance against
                  both the Kenyatta and Moi governments since the 1966 fallout and his eventual
                  banishment in 1969.

            Economic marginalization of Coast
            239.	 Like the former North Eastern Province, the NFD in general and Nyanza, the Coast
                  region could be placed in the category of ‘politically dissident’ regions that have
                  suffered marginalization under successive regimes. However, marginalization
                  experienced in the Coast, especially when understood from the point of view of
                  dispossession, is due also to the confluence of interests arising from the region’s
                  strategic value as a principal gateway to the country and the East and Central
                  African region and its valued seafront land resources.

            240.	 Submissions from Coast residents invariably link their state of economic
                  marginalisation marked by poverty, illiteracy and lack of access to basic services
                  to frequent land-related dispossessions. The Commission heard many accounts of
                  police brutality and other kinds of mistreatment by the provincial administration,
                  including extra-judicial killings, arrest and imprisonment of those who agitate for
                  restitution, as well as the destruction of property and evictions of those who live
                  off these lands with contested titles.

            Economic marginalization of Western
            241.	 While many perceive Western as a marginalized region, this characterization has
                  not featured as prominently in formal accounts as has been the case for Nyanza,
                  Northern Kenya and the Coast regions. This depiction is perhaps attributable to a
                  combination of factors, including the fact that due to its rich fertile soils that favour
                  agriculture and relative security, Western has been perceived to be economically
                  stable, in spite of the high levels of poverty.

            242.	 Western has often been ignored in classification of marginalized regions in Kenya,
                  yet its historical evolution and political fortunes are closely tied with that of Nyanza
                  province, which is acknowledged in formal accounts as a marginalized region.
                  Backed up with a history that lacks political favour with successive governments and
                  the high level of poverty, it is evident that Western Kenya is marginalized. Recent
                  trends reveal that the region has been forgotten in the development agenda.

Economic marginalization of North Rift
243.	 The North Rift region has experienced political marginalisation since the colonial
      period. Regarded as part of the Northern Frontier region (together with North
      Eastern Province), the closed-area policy imposed by the colonial regime isolated
      the region from the rest of the country and made it impenetrable by ‘outsiders’.

244.	 In contemporary times, the people of North Rift have complained that they are
      inadequately represented in national political institutions and the public service
      since independence. It is a glaring contradiction that in representation in Parliament,
      a vast county like Turkana (with an area covering 77 000 square kilometers and a
      population of one million) only has three constituencies. Furthermore, for a long
      time it has been administered as one district.




   Recommendations
        	   The Commission recommends that, within 12 months of the submission
            of this Report, the government formulate, adopt and implement a policy
            that deliberately targets the socio-economic development of historically
            marginalised regions identified by the Commission.
        	   The policy must include strategic development plans and budgetary allocations
            aimed at the economic and social development of marginalised communities.
        	   The policy must recognise that these reparative actions are over and above
            the provisions of Article 204 of the Constitution (2010) in utilisation of the
            Equalisation Fund.
        	   The Government consider actions such as building an efficient road networks
            linking marginalized areas with the rest of Kenya, building boreholes and
            water-catchment systems, building hospitals within reach of all communities
            adequately stocked and well-staffed, schools with adequate facilities, courts of
            law, and ensure that all government services and public facilities are available
            to them.
        	   In the five years subsequent to the enactment of the policy, preference be given
            to marginalised regions in the sharing of national revenues as envisaged under
            Article 202 of the Constitution (2010) to ensure that the development projects
            are realised and the policy is implemented.




                               REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION                      53
Volume IV   Chapter ONE




            Land and Conflict
            245.	 The Commission finds that there is a very close linkage between land injustices and
                  ethnic violence in Kenya. More specifically, land related injustices are prominent
                  factors that precipitate violence between and within ethnic tribes in Kenya.

            246.	 The Commission finds that land-related injustices take many forms, including: illegal
                  alienation and acquisition of individual and community land by public and private
                  entities, illegal alienation of public land and trust lands, preferential treatment of
                  members of specific ethnic groups in settlement schemes at the expense of the most
                  deserving landless, forceful settlement of members of a community outside of their
                  homelands, forceful evictions and the phenomenon of land grabbing, especially by
                  government officials.

            247.	 The Commission finds that land-related injustices started recognizably during
                  the period of colonization at the coast by Arabs and, later, by the British both at
                  the coast and in mainland Kenya. However, indigenous Kenyans expected the
                  injustices to be fully addressed soon after independence but the first independence
                  government failed to fully and genuinely address the problems.

            248.	 The Commission finds that all post independence governments have failed to
                  honestly and adequately address land-related injustices that started with colonialism.

            249.	 The Commission finds that failure of both colonial and post-independence
                  governments to address the problem of landlessness is the reason individuals and
                  communities often resort to self-help measures, including violence.

            250.	 The Commission finds that existing land-related injustices are sometimes taken
                  advantage of or used to address other societal problems, especially political
                  differences.

            251.	 The Commission finds that athough land-related injustices have affected virtually
                  every part of Kenya, communities at the coast, especially the Mijikenda, the Taita
                  and Pokomo have suffered the most and the longest.

            252.	 The Commission finds that land-related injustices at the coast constitute one of
                  the key reasons for underdevelopment in the area. Land-related injustices at the
                  coast lie at the root of the emergence of the Mombasa Republican Council (MRC).

            253.	 The Commission finds that the Provincial administration has pervasively and
                  significantly perpetrated land-related injustices including forceful evictions of
                  individuals and communities and land grabbing for personal gain, and should

      not at all participate in any efforts to redress land related problems in the new
      constitutional dispensation because of their lack of moral authority and support.

254.	 The Commission finds that the current constitutional dispensation, including
      the new constitutional body on land and related laws, provide a sound basis to
      fully address land-related injustices, including historical ones, but only if there is
      political will to so use these laws and institutions.




   Recommendations
        	   The Commission recommends that the Ministry of Lands or other appropriate
            government authority immediately begins a process of surveying, demarcating
            and registering all remaining government lands, including those that were
            formerly owned or managed by local authorities, all protected wildlife areas
            and river banks, among other public lands.
        	   The Commission recommends that the National Land Commission commences
            work with the Ministry of Lands and settlement to undertake adjudication
            and registration exercises at the coast and all other areas where the same has
            not been conducted. Measures shall be designed to revoke illegally obtained
            titles to and re-open all public beaches, beach access routes and fish landing
            beaches, especially at the coast.
        	   The Commission recommends that the National Land Commission in
            furtherance of its mandate expedites the process of addressing and/or
            recovering all irregularly/illegally acquired land. Measures should be designed
            by the Ministry of Lands and settlement to encourage individuals and entities
            to surrender illegally acquired land.
        	   The Commission recommends that the Ministry of Land in conjunction with the
            National Land Commission design and implement measures to revoke illegally
            obtained tittles and restore public easements
        	   The Commission recommends that the National Land Commission develops,
            maintains and regularly up dates a computerized inventory of all lands in Kenya,
            including private land that should be accessible to all Kenyans as required by
            law. Land registries country wide should be computerized and made easily
            accessible as required by the law.
        	   The Commission recommends that the National Land Commission formulates
            and implement strict guidelines in terms of maximum acreage an individual or
            company can buy hold in respect of private land.




                               REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION                      55
Volume IV   Chapter ONE




            Economic Crimes and Grand Corruption
            255.	 The Commission finds that corruption is endemic in Kenya. This is despite of the
                  fact that there has been a growing public awareness of the consequences of
                  corruption, its negative and destructive effects on the economy and development,
                  and the need to eliminate corruption.

            256.	 There is a direct link between corruption and gross violation of human rights.
                  Individuals have been killed, tortured and subjected to other violations of human
                  rights because of their efforts to combat corruption.

            257.	 Corruption has a disproportionate impact on vulnerable groups such as the poor,
                  minorities and indigenous people, women, children, persons with disabilities, people
                  living with HIV/AIDS, refugees and internally displaced persons, and prisoners.
                  Members of these groups are more and are less able to defend themselves.

            258.	 Poor people are affected by corruption because it diverts resources from investment
                  in infrastructure that is crucial to lift them out of poverty. Corruption undermines
                  the quality of public services on which the poor depend particularly to meet their
                  basic needs. Minority and indigenous people suffer effects of corruption when they
                  are displaced by, for example, corruptly approved infrastructure developments.



                Recommendations
                      	   The Commission recommends the formulation of a national anti-corruption policy to
                          guide the war against corruption. It is necessary to criminalise other offences that are
                          in United Nations Convention Against Corruption but not yet domesticated in Kenya.
                      	   The Commission recommends that the provisions of Anti-Corruption and Economic
                          Crimes Act, Public Officers Ethics Act, Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission Act and
                          the Leadership and Integrity Act be harmonised to avoid confusion and duplicity. The
                          Commission recommends the merging of all the four pieces of legislation into one.
                      	   The Commission recommends that the number of commissioners of the Ethics and
                          Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) be increased to the maximum constitutional
                          limit of nine (9). An increased number of staff is also required to deal with the
                          increased workload created by the two levels of government with the attendant
                          huge sums of public funds being allocated to the 47 counties. There is a real danger
                          of corruption being ‘devolved’ to the counties unless the EACC is quickly restructured,
                          empowered and visible at both levels of government.
                      	   The Cmmission recommends that the EACC be given a sound constitutional
                          grounding through amendment of Article 79 of the Constitution to specifically
                          provide for its powers and functions as is the case with other Constitutional
                          commissions.

                                                                                        Vol u m e IV   Chapter ONE




        	   The Commission recommends the clarification of the definition of integrity and
            the attendant integrity threshold that should be used to either disqualify or
            remove a person from public office. Chapter 6 of Constitution of Kenya 2010,
            if properly interpreted and applied, will definitely be a major boost in the war
            against corruption in Kenya. It should be clearly defined as to when the integrity
            bar begins to operate, that is, whether it is at the time:
              	when mere allegations are made against an individual
              	when an individual is under investigation
              	when an individual is under prosecution
              	when an individual is convicted, or
              	when an individual has exhausted his right of appeal after conviction
        	   The EACC shall commence or hasten investigations into grand corruption scandals
            mentioned in this Report, which have remained un resolved for many years.
            Appropriate criminal and or civil sanctions must thereafter be taken against the
            perpetrators of grand corruption and economic crimes.




Ethnic Tension
259.	 The Commission finds that colonial government pursued a policy of ‘divide and
      rule’ in order to consolidate their hold on the country, and to lessen the possibility
      that the African population would resist colonial rule. To that end, the colonial
      government magnified the differences between the various communities and
      regions, and stereotyped each community in a manner that would sow suspicion,
      hatred and the sense of ‘otherness’.

260.	 The Commission finds that the colonial government created ethnically defined
      administrative boundaries. In determining such boundaries, no serious thought
      was given to historical inter-ethnic interactions and relations.

261.	 The Commission finds that the colonial government focused on developing
      infrastructure and social services in productive areas of the country (the so called
      ‘White Highlands’) at the expense of the rest of the country. The resulting inequality
      remained largely unaddressed in the policies and practices of independent Kenya.
      The preferential treatment given to some areas of the country because of their
      clear productivity thus led to differential treatment of ethnic communities that
      were patterned around the ethnic enclaves created by the colonial government.




                               REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION                      57
Volume IV   Chapter ONE




            262.	 The Commission finds that the colonial land policy, particularly in the so-called
                  ‘white highlands,’ contributed enormously to regional and ethnic marginalisation
                  from the economy. Colonial land policies resulted in displacement, the creation of
                  ‘native reserves’, as well as the movement of masses of population from areas of
                  their habitual residence to completely different regions and settling them on lands
                  that traditionally belonged to other communities.

            263.	 The Commission finds that Kenya entered the era of independence with a
                  heightened sense of ethnicity that continued to divide rather than unite the
                  country. However, ruling elites in independent Kenya did not have the political
                  will or commitment to create a truly democratic and prosperous Kenya for all its
                  citizens. The result was the worsening of ethnic relations such that by 2007 long
                  standing grievances erupted into an unprecedented scale of violence.

            264.	 The Commission finds that in the post-independence period, causes of ethnic
                  tension include the following:

                     	   Insider/Outsider dynamics: Ethnic tension and violence occur when
                          communities assert a superior claim over a territory at the expense of or to the
                          exclusion of others. Such superior claims are based on the assumption that
                          ownership or occupation at some point in the past created an exclusive claim for
                          such ownership or occupation in the present. Such exclusive claims to territory
                          inevitably create classes of ‘insiders’ and ‘outsiders’. This perception of people as
                          outsiders as opposed to fellow citizens often lead to increased tension based on
                          ethnicity which, in turn, created the potential for ethnic violence.

                     	   Of names and their meaning: In Coast and Rift Valley alike, a thorny issue
                          that is intricately tied to the notion of insiders and outsiders relates to names
                          of places. In particular, local communities in these two regions are aggrieved
                          that places occupied by those they consider outsiders have been given
                          ‘outside names’.

                     	   State sanction of outside/insider notions: The designation of a community
                          as ‘other’ or as an outsider has sometimes found support in state policy. In
                          the northern region of the country, particularly in those areas that made up
                          the former North Eastern Province, the Government has institutionalised the
                          disparate treatment of Kenyans based on ethnicity by requiring that Kenyans
                          of Somali origin carry a special pass




58          REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION
                                                                                 Vol u m e IV   Chapter ONE




      	   Negative perceptions and stereotypes: Negative perceptions and
           stereotypes are a major cause of ethnic tension in the country. Labels have been
           put on certain communities, portraying them in broad, often negative terms
           that generalise certain traits and apply them to all individuals belonging to
           the described community, regardless of how individuals perceive themselves.
           For example, the Kikuyu are sometimes described as thieves, the Maasai as
           primitive, the Somali as terrorists, etc.

      	   Culture and stereotypes: While the colonial government played an important
           role in cultivating ethnic stereotypes, the Commission also received evidence
           that some stereotypes are drawn from and driven by traditional cultural beliefs
           and practices. For instance, the Commission heard that men from communities
           that do not practice male circumcision have always been stigmatised and
           regarded as lesser or weaker men, and therefore, incapable of or unsuitable to
           take political leadership of the country.

      	   Ethnicity and access to public office: The perception that ethnic representation
           in government results in direct economic and other benefits to the represented
           community is pervasive in Kenya. While the Commission acquired evidence
           that such benefits do not necessarily accrue to those communities who are
           represented - even in the highest offices of the land - the perception that they
           do leads to intense competition for such representation, and thus increases the
           likelihood of violence during elections.




Ethnic Tension, Land and Politics in Mt. Elgon
265.	 The Commission finds that the emergence of the Sabaot Land Defence Force in the
      Mt. Elgon region was precipitated largely by government failure to fully address
      land-related injustices that members of the Sabaot community have suffered since
      the colonial period.

266.	 The Commission finds that the SLDF was responsible for numerous gross violations
      of human rights including killings, torture, mutilation, and sexual violence.

267.	 The Commission finds that during Operation Okoa Maisha the Kenya Police and the
      military were equally responsible for gross violations of human rights including
      killings, enforced disappearance, torture, and sexual violence.

                Recommendations
                      	   The Commission recommends that within six months of the issuance of
                          this Report, the President offers a public and unconditional apology to the
                          people of Mt. Elgon for the atrocities committed against them by the Kenya
                          Police and the Kenya Army and for the failure of the state to protect them
                          against atrocities committed by SLDF
                      	   The Commission recommends that within six months of the issuance of
                          this Report, the Government establishes a trauma and healing center in Mt.
                          Elgon region for purposes of providing psychosocial support to the victims
                          and survivors of Mt. Elgon conflict. Special attention be paid to widows in the
                          region.
                      	   The Commission recommends that individuals who suffered atrocities
                          during the Mt. Elgon conflict be provided with reparation in accordance with
                          the Reparation Framework proposed by the Commission.
                      	   The Commission recommends the establishment of a monument in Mt.
                          Elgon to commemorate the victims and survivors of the Mt. Elgon conflict,
                          especially those who were killed or forcefully disappeared both by the SLDF
                          and state security agents.
                      	   The Commission recommends that within 18 months of the issuance of this
                          Report, the Government maps all mass graves and other locations where
                          bodies were dumped or disposed of during the Mt. Elgon conflict, with a
                          view to exhuming and identifying the bodies for proper burial.
                      	   The Commission recommends the prosecution of the following individuals
                          against whom it received evidence of involvement in militia activities in Mt.
                          Elgon including financing, planning and instigating violence in the region:
                          Fred Chesebe Kapondi; John Bomet Serut; and Jackson Psongoiywo.
                      	   The Commission recommends the prosecution of Colonel Stephen Boiywo
                          who was serving as the Commanding Officer during the military intervention
                          in Mt. Elgon in 2008 referred to as Operation Rudi Nyumbani during which
                          numerous gross violations were committed by members of the Kenya Army.
                      	   The Commission recommends that the Police Service Commission ensures
                          that every police station in Kenya reflects ethnic diversity and gender
                          balance.

Reconciliation
268.	 For decades, Kenya has remained a nation in which communities stand divided
      along ethnic and regional lines, suspicious and distrustful of one another. Over
      the decades, feelings of inter-community distrust, even hatred, have festered
      mainly because a myriad of issues which are at the core of nation-building have
      largely remained unresolved. These issues include access to land, inequality and
      regional imbalances, and impunity combined with a lack of transparency and
      accountability. These issues have eroded a sense of belonging, nationhood, and
      public trust in political and governance institutions.

269.	 Since independence, successive governments have employed silence, denial and
      selective amnesia whenever individuals and agencies have raised the need to
      address these fundamental issues. Painful memories have been passed from one
      generation to another, and as a consequence present generations continue to hold
      grudges for violations and historical injustices meted against their forefathers and
      mothers. Until now, the scale and impact of human rights violations and historical
      injustices have neither been fully acknowledged nor sufficiently addressed.

270.	 Meaningful reconciliation is not an event, but rather a long process. The decision
      to reconcile is a personal decision, aimed at setting the stage and establishing the
      basis for the beginning of a reconciliation process.

271.	 The Commission acknowledges the efforts undertaken by civil society and faith-
      based organizations in fostering organizations. However, it is noteworthy that
      most of these efforts have been reactive rather than proactive, short term rather
      than long term, and uncoordinated and unsustainable.

272.	 The Commission finds that at the individual level, many Kenyans who have been
      victims of injustices and atrocities require psycho-social support. This is a necessary
      in order for them to engage in a process of reconciliation.

273.	 The Commission finds that District Peace Committees are under-utilized and
      not widely known amongst many Kenyans. This is partly due to lack of adequate
      funding of the District Peace Committees.

Volume IV   Chapter ONE




                Recommendations
                      	   The Commission recommends that within six months of the issuance of this
                          Report, the President convenes a National Reconciliation Conference/Day, during
                          which the President and heads of the various security agencies shall offer a public
                          apology for violations and injustices committed during the mandate period. The
                          President shall also outline the nation’s Reconciliation Agenda. Representatives of
                          victim groups from around the country shall be facilitated to attend the conference.
                          The Commission further recommends that the day on which the Reconciliation
                          Conference will be held should be declared a public holiday in order to ensure a
                          nation-wide focus on the subject of national healing and reconciliation.
                      	   The Commission recommends that alleged perpetrators of ethnic incitement
                          and violence be investigated and prosecuted accordingly, notwithstanding
                          their official or other status. The Director of Public Prosecutions shall ensure that
                          those individuals recommended for investigation or prosecution by previous
                          commissions of inquiry on ethnic violence, namely the Parliamentary Select
                          Committee to Investigate Ethnic Clashes in Western Kenya and Other Parts of
                          Kenya (Kiliku Commission), and Judicial Commission of Inquiry into Tribal Clashes
                          in Kenya (Akiwumi Commission), are prosecuted or investigated. The Director of
                          Public Prosecutions shall also take action in respect to the recommendations of
                          various reports of the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights on ethnic
                          and political violence including its report on the 2007/2008 PEV. The Commission
                          has compiled a list of adversely mentioned persons in these reports to aid their
                          identification.
                      	   The Commission recommends that within 3 months of the issuance of this Report,
                          the Director of Public Prosecutions shall issue a public report indicating the
                          progress that the office has made in investigating and prosecuting the 2007/2008
                          Post-Election related cases.
                      	   The Commission notes that there is a lack of a coordinated and streamlined
                          approach to the subject of peacebuilding and reconciliation in the country.
                          Multiple state organizations are involved in this endeavor without much formal
                          coordination. The Commission recommends the evaluation of all institutions and
                          mechanism involved in peacebuilding, reconciliation and early warning with a
                          view to harmonizing their activities and adopting a coordinated approach.
                      	   The Commission recommends that concerted efforts be taken to foster
                          reconciliation and cohesion in areas where there has been a perennial problem
                          of ethnic tension and violence. In this regard, the Commission recommends that
                          comprehensive and sustained community dialogues be carried out in these areas.
                      	   The Commission recommends that District Peace Committees be adequately
                          funded and the public be made aware of the existence of these committees.
                      	   The Commission recommends that the Ministry of Education develops a peace
                          education curriculum for use in schools.

                          Fear is in my heart
                In the street, I pass calling for justice
            In the police station, I pass calling for justice
                 In the court, I pass calling for justice
         When I saw streams of blood flowing down the road
                      I could not believe my eyes
                        For what man had done
                 Killing innocent people mercilessly
                           Fear is in my heart
                        Justice! I call for justice
                        Children are left orphans
                  Rolling on the street meaninglessly
                    Sleeping on the street hungry
                   And the cold breaking their ribs
                      I am afraid of losing my life
                           Fear is in my heart
                         Justice! I call for justice

                  Recalling the love of their husband
                  Recalling the loss of their children
                          Fear is in my heart
                        Justice! I call for justice
                        Justice! where are you?
                             In the police?

                        Justice? where are you?
                              Truth be told
                           Justice to prevail

      Implementation and Monitoring
                         Mechanism


Introduction
1.	   Past experiences with the work of truth commissions and commissions of inquiry
      around the world have shown that a major challenge lies in the implementation of
      the recommendations contained in the reports of these commissions. More often
      than not, the life of these commissions ends at the point of submission of their
      final report, leaving the implementation to other actors who often do not follow
      through with the recommendations. This challenge has also characterized the
      work of many commissions of inquiry in Kenya in the past.

2.	   The consequences of this challenge have been to limit the impact of the work
      of these commissions and to contribute to public fatigue and disappointment
      about such commissions after expectations were raised. The drafters of the TJR Act
      must have had this challenge in mind when they empowered the Commission to
      recommend an implementation mechanism to ensure its recommendations are
      duly and timely implemented, and to monitor progress in that implementation. The
      government is expressly obligated under the TJR Act to create the implementation
      mechanism as set out in this Report. In this Chapter, the Commission provides
      for the nature, composition and functions of the Implementation Committee
      envisaged in the law.




                                                                                           71
Volume IV   Chapter TWO




            Mandatory Nature of Commission’s
            Recommendations
            3.	       Recommendations contained in this Report are, in Parliament’s wisdom, of
                      mandatory application and must be complied with by all constitutional, legislative
                      and administrative institutions and bodies so as to achieve the object and purpose
                      of the TJR Act expressed in the Preamble and the relevant sections therein. This is
                      clearly stipulated under Section 50(2) of the TJR Act which states that:
                           All recommendations shall be implemented, and where the implementation of any
                           recommendation has not been complied with, the National Assembly shall require the
                           Minister to furnish it with reasons for non-implementation.

            4.	       Furthermore, the Minister (or Cabinet Secretary in the language of the Constitution
                      of Kenya, 2010) is tasked with reporting on the progress of the implementation
                      of the Commission’s Report to the National Assembly within three months of
                      submission of the Report, and twice a year thereafter.1 Section 49(3) further states
                      that implementation of the Report of the Commission shall commence within six
                      months upon publication of the Report.

            5.	       In relation to the provisions of section 50(2), the Commission recommends that the
                      Cabinet Secretary’s reasons for any non-compliance and non-implementation with
                      its recommendations must take cognizance of and be evaluated on the basis of the
                      following principles:

                       	    The primary responsibility of implementing the recommendations resides
                             with the State;

                       	    The State shall ensure all state organs and public officers with a duty to
                             implement the recommendations are indeed doing so and that organs or
                             officers not in compliance shall face appropriate sanction;

                       	    The State shall be required to demonstrate that it is undertaking the legislative,
                             policy and other measures required to implement the recommendations.

                       	    In the event that the State cites resource constraints as the cause for non-
                             compliance, the State shall be required to demonstrate that the resources are
                             not available and further articulate an action plan for resource mobilization.

72          REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION
                                                                                                                     Vol u m e IV     Chapter TWO




6.	       In addition to the express provisions of the TJR Act, it is noteworthy that in terms
          of international best practice governments are obliged to ‘undertake to give due
          consideration’ to the findings and recommendations of investigative reports into
          human rights violations.2 The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights
          has issued a statement on the obligation of member states to facilitate truth-seeking
          tribunals and ‘encourages the States concerned to disseminate, implement, and
          monitor implementation of, the recommendations of non-judicial mechanisms
          such as truth and reconciliation commissions, and provide information regarding
          compliance with the decisions of judicial mechanisms.’3



Authority for an Implementation and Monitoring
Mechanism
7.	       Section 48(2)(f ) of the TJR Act mandates the Commission to ‘make recommendations
          on the mechanism and framework for the implementation of its recommendations
          and an institutional arrangement in that connection.’4 The Act then requires the
          Minister of Justice to operationalise the implementation mechanism as proposed
          by the Commission:

               The Minister shall, upon the publication of the report of the Commission, operationalize
               the implementation mechanism or arrangement in accordance with the recommendations
               of the Commission under section (48) (2) (f) to monitor the implementation of the
               recommendations of the Commission and to facilitate their implementation.5

8.	       The provision for an implementation mechanism in the TJR Act is no doubt borne
          out of the experience of past truth commissions and other commissions of inquiry
          in Kenya. Indeed, the drafters had foresight in proposing that a body be created
          to lead and facilitate implementation of the Report. This model is replicated in the
          implementation of the Constitution with the creation of the Commission for the
          Implementation of the Constitution, albeit with a decidedly different and broader
          mandate.

                    and to facilitate their implementation’. This provision thus envisages a dual mandate
                    for the mechanism: to monitor and to facilitate implementation of the Commission’s
                    recommendations.

            Objectives of the Mechanism
            10.	    The objectives of the implementation and monitoring mechanism are to:

                    	    Work with relevant agencies and departments of government, civil society,
                          faith based organisations, the private sector, international donors, and any
                          other relevant individual or organisation to facilitate the implementation of
                          the Commission’s recommendations

                    	    Monitor and report to the public with respect to the fulfilment of specific
                          recommendations, including progress made on implementation since the last
                          monitoring report

                    	    Manage and administer the Reparations Fund

                    	    Any other activity necessary to fulfil the letter and spirit of the recommendations
                          in this Report.

            Nature of the Mechanism
            11.	    The Commission is sensitive to balancing a number of important objectives in
                    its recommendation for an implementation mechanism. First, it is imperative
                    that the Commission’s Report, the result of close to four years of work, be widely
                    disseminated and accessible to the Kenyan public, and in particular to the thousands
                    of Kenyans who directly participated in and contributed to the Commission’s work.
                    As noted in other parts of this Report, far too often commissions of inquiry have
                    been established in Kenya at the expense of the public taxpayer only to have their
                    reports withheld from public dissemination.

            12.	    Second, it is imperative that the Commission’s recommendations, including but
                    not limited to recommendations related to reparations, be fully implemented.
                    Most truth commissions are criticized for having engaged with victims, raised
                    their expectations, and then dashed their hopes by not providing for or resulting
                    in concrete reparations. This is often not because the commissions themselves
                    do not recognize the need for such reparations; rather it is often because the
                    commissions themselves do not have the power to grant reparations, and while
                    they recommend such reparations there is little or no political will to implement
                    such recommendations. The drafters of the TJR Act must have been aware of




74          REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION
                                                                               Vol u m e IV   Chapter TWO




       this problem with previous truth commissions, and thus both provided that our
       recommendations would be binding as a matter of law, and that the Commission
       would be empowered to create its own implementation mechanism.

13.	   Third, given the importance of many of the recommendations included in this
       Report, including the recommendations related to reparations, the Commission
       realized that the implementation mechanism would need to be independent of
       those bodies to which such recommendations are directed in order to monitor them
       effectively. In addition, the Commission was concerned that the implementation
       mechanism be sufficiently resourced in terms of time and staff to ensure effective
       monitoring and that its recommendations were in fact implemented. With effective
       monitoring and other related activity it is more likely that the recommendations
       would be implemented thus ensuring that Kenya would not be subject to the same
       criticism as other countries which had created truth commissions but then done
       little or nothing to provide for reparations and the fulfilment of other important
       recommendations.

14.	   Based upon these and other considerations, the Commission decided not to
       recommend that an already existing organization be the primary entity tasked
       with monitoring and implementing the Commission’s recommendations. First,
       those existing independent organizations whose mandate is related to the work
       of the Commission (such as the KNCHR and NCIC) already have a full plate of
       activities and already face challenges with respect to inadequate resources to
       fulfil their current obligations. Placing even more obligations on such bodies
       would risk them being spread too thin with inadequate resources, or force them
       to choose between their existing activities with those activities related to the
       Commission. Second, while government agencies are less likely to have resource
       constraints, they are tasked with implementing many of the recommendations in
       this Report and thus would not be able to provide the independent and credible
       monitoring of their own activities. Finally, given that the implementation
       mechanism will also be continuing some of the work of the Commission – most
       notably administering the Reparations Fund – it is proper that the mechanism be
       an independent legal entity in the same way that the Commission was.

15.	   The Commission thus recommends the establishment of a Committee for the
       Implementation of the Recommendations of the Truth, Justice and Reconciliation
       Commission (the “Implementation Committee’). The Implementation Committee
       shall be established by legislation. A proposed bill title ‘Committee for the
       Implementation of the Recommendations of the Truth, Justice and Reconciliation
       Commission Act’ is annexed to this Chapter.

Volume IV   Chapter TWO




            The Implementation Committee
            16.	    The Implementation Committee shall be the main body responsible for implementing
                    and monitoring the implementation of the Report of the Commission. It shall be
                    an independent body with its own offices and budget, including the ability to raise
                    its own funds. The Implementation Committee will be supported by a Technical
                    Secretariat.

            17.	    It is recommended that Parliament pass a law establishing the Committee and
                    providing for its functions, powers and other related issues as proposed in this
                    part within one month of the issuance of this Report. The TJR Act provides that the
                    Commission shall be dissolved within three months of submission of its Report to
                    the President and the public. In this regard, it is important that the Implementation
                    Committee be in place before the Commission is dissolved in order to allow for
                    a smooth and direct handover of sensitive documents in the custody of the
                    Commission to the Implementation Committee.

            18.	    The Committee shall be an independent body corporate with perpetual succession
                    and a common seal. The Committee shall in its corporate name, be capable of —

                    	    suing and being sued;

                    	    acquiring, holding, charging and disposing of movable and immovable
                          property;

                    	    borrowing and raising money from governmental and non-governmental
                          sources; and

                    	    doing or performing all such other things or acts for the proper discharge of
                          its functions under the Constitution and this Act.

            19.	    The headquarters of the Committee shall be in Nairobi, but the Committee may
                    establish other offices at any place in Kenya.



            Composition of the Committee
            20.	    The Implementation Committee shall consist of a Chairperson and four (4) other
                    members appointed through an open and transparent process.

            21.	 The Chairperson and members of the Committee shall have the following
                 qualifications:

       	   Knowledge and experience in matters of transitional justice, human rights,
            reparations, law, gender or governance. The Chairperson shall be a person of
            15 years experience in his/her field of experience while the members shall be
            persons of 10 years experience in their field of expertise.

       	   A citizen of Kenya

       	   Satisfy the requirements of Chapter Six of the Constitution

       	   Shall not be a state officer

22.	   Appointment of the Chairperson and members of the Committee shall be through
       an open and transparent process involving as set out by Parliament.

Functions of the Committee
23.	   The Committee shall have the following functions:
       	   Primary responsibility for the implementation of the aspects of the report
            assigned to it, in particular:
            	 management        and administration of the Reparations Fund;
            	 map, register and process victims’ claims using the Commission’s database

                as the starting point (see details below);
            	 facilitating, in consultation with the relevant government body, the process

                of memorialization in line with the recommendations set out in this Report;
                and
            	 management     and securing of the archives of the Commission, with due
                regard to the importance of transparency and access to information, and
                consistent with the promises of confidentiality made to specific individuals
                and organizations.

       	   Monitor the implementation of the aspects of the Commission’s Report assigned
            to government ministries, departments and commissions.

       	   Solicit, accept, manage and administer funds from the government, donors,
            and others dedicated to the Reparations Fund.

       	   Ensure public awareness of the process at each stage, through appropriate
            media activity, public education forums and liaison/information sessions
            with victims, community based organisations, faith based organisations and
            civil society in general. In particular, the Committee shall implement a public

                          outreach and awareness campaign through the development of a transparent
                          and comprehensive outreach plan in consultation with relevant government
                          bodies, civil society groups, and victim representatives. The plan will be publicly
                          available for comment and input and will specify measures of cooperation
                          with local organizations and victim advocacy groups, as well as measures
                          to reach out to women and girls, persons with disabilities, people living with
                          HIV/AIDS, minorities and marginalized communities who have traditionally
                          been excluded from public life. The Committee’s Outreach Strategy should be
                          carefully conceptualized so as to:

                          	 Manage     victim expectations about the reparations process
                          	 Clearly    explain who is eligible for what type of reparations under the
                               scheme
                          	 	Clearly explain why and how decisions about eligibility have been made
                          	   Pilot-test outreach methods before creating any nationwide effort
                          	   Take advantage of new technologies to save costs and reach previously
                               marginalized groups
                          	   Reflect the stepped approach to reparations registration and the priorities
                               of the eligibility policy, described below.
                          	   Encourage group claims when appropriate.

                    	    Recruit in an open and transparent process, the Chief Executive Officer and
                          other staff of the Technical Secretariat

                    	    Disseminate the final report and other Commission-related published materials
                          to the public

                    	    Facilitating the preservation, security, and public access to the archives of the
                          Commission

                    	    Create a monitoring and evaluation plan to measure progress periodically on
                          the implementation process;

                    	    Prepare and publish periodic reports relating to its activities including
                          implementation and monitoring of implementation of the Report.

            Powers of the Committee
            24.	    The Commission recommends that the Committee shall have all powers necessary
                    for the execution of its functions related to the implementation and monitoring of
                    the Report of the Commission.



78          REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION
                                                                                     Vol u m e IV   Chapter TWO




25.	   The Commission recommends that the Act establishing the Committee shall impose
       an obligation upon government departments and all organs of state to respond
       timeously to each reasonable request made by the Committee in pursuance of its
       obligations.

Technical Secretariat
26.	   The Committee shall be supported by a Technical Secretariat headed by a Chief
       Executive Officer and have a core staff comprising of experts in the following
       fields: communications/outreach; reparations and transitional justice; land;
       human rights; reconciliation and peacebuilding; and such other experts whose
       skills may be relevant in the implementation and monitoring of the Commission’s
       Report.

27.	   The Commission recommends that the core staff at the Technical Secretariat be
       full time employees. The Technical Secretariat should be empowered to engage
       such other staff on full-time and consultancy basis as is necessary for the effective
       performance of its duties.

28.	   The Committee should, where appropriate, set up a reference group and or ad
       hoc thematic sub-committees consisting of key government departments, civil
       society and victims’ organisations to provide focused policy orientation of the
       implementation process.

Staffing of the Secretariat
29.	   It is recommended that the Implementation Committee’s Technical Secretariat
       establish the following units, or a comparable structure that ensures it can
       effectively fulfil its functions:
            	   Outreach & Registration Unit
             	Evaluation   & Classification Unit
             	Individual   Claims Section
             	Group    Claims Section
             	Victim   Participation, Gender and Minorities Unit

30.	   Each unit will make an assessment of its staffing and support needs based on its
       functions. Moreover, each unit should include a gender focal point to ensure equal
       access for women in the reparations process. The Implementation Committee will
       then assess the capability of relevant existing structures to provide services and staff

Volume IV   Chapter TWO




                     support to be coordinated by the Implementation Committee. The Implementation
                     Committee will make specific requests to government bodies, ministries, INGOs and
                     NGOs to second staff, provide services (based upon a transparent list of criteria),
                     and make available other support to the Implementation Committee. Memoranda
                     of Understanding will be completed with relevant actors to delineate roles and
                     supervising structures.6

            31.	     For example, the Implementation Committee might establish MOUs with civil
                     society organizations across the country to undertake effective outreach related
                     to the reparations program. CSOs would undergo training coordinated by the
                     Implementation Committee, would undertake activities as designated by the
                     Implementation Committee, but would remain employees or volunteers of their
                     respective organizations.7 The Implementation Committee would closely monitor
                     the implementation of activities in such a case and would take corrective action,
                     even to the extent of revoking an MOU, should that become necessary.8



            Operationalization of the Implementation
            Committee
            32.	     The TJR Act provides that the Minister shall upon the publication of this Report
                     operationalize the implementation mechanism as recommended by this
                     Commission.9 The Act also states that the implementation of the Report shall
                     commence within six months upon publication. As already indicated above, it is
                     imperative that Implementation Mechanism be put in place before the Commission
                     is dissolved. This will allow for the smooth and direct transfer of sensitive and
                     confidential documents in the custody of the Commission to the Implementation
                     Committee. In making this proposal, the Commission took note of its mandatory
                     obligation under section 52(2)(a)(ii) which requires the Commission to organize
                     its archives and records giving special consideration to ‘the measures that may be
                     necessary to protect confidential information’.
            6	   This model is proposed in order to ensure maximum efficiency of the reparations programme and to ensure that entities with
                 relevant expertise are mobilized to carry out the reparations mandate. Because resources are necessarily limited, it is critical
                 to ensure that any reparations structure does not create a large bureaucracy that consumes resources that could otherwise be
                 directly used on reparations programmes. It must be made clear in any enabling legislation that government bodies at the national
                 and local level have a responsibility to cooperate with the Implementation Committee and to provide such staff and support as
                 is reasonably requested. This will also require that the enabling legislation mandate ministries to allocate funds for reparations
                 support and implementation in their budgets.
            7	   Guidelines related to funding arrangements for the implementation of service by non-governmental organizations will need to be
                 developed, depending on the overall budget for the Implementation Committee and the types of organizations involved.
            8	   Clear performance criteria should be drafted into every MOU, linked to victim participation and satisfaction, so that the conditions
                 for revocation of the MOU are clear to both parties to the agreement.

33.	   Should the Implementation Committee not be operationalized within three
       months, it is recommended that the Secretariat of the Commission remain in
       place until such a time as the Implementation Committee is operationalized. In
       this regard, the Commission Secretariat shall be the immediate successor in law
       to the Commission. The Secretariat shall be charged with the safe custody of
       the Commission’s documents and materials. The Secretariat shall stand dissolved
       upon the transfer of its materials to the Implementation Committee.

                        We need total compensation for both economic and social crimes.
                          How do we get compensation? Our version of compensation
                         will be in terms of infrastructural development and educational
                        development. When I talk of infrastructure, I want all the roads in
                       North Eastern Province to be tarmacked. There is only one kilometre
                        of tarmac, even as we are talking, in the entire province which is
                        one third of Kenyan land mass. The roads are usually impassable
                          during the rainy season. If that is done urgently, some kind of
                         healing will come up. It will be difficult to ascertain individual
                                   compensation because they are in thousands..

                         We want this community to have a tarmac road in Teso District
                           and if possible, it be named after Tito Adungosi. We need
                        something monumental about Tito. This monument has to be built
                          at the county headquarters as a reminder of Tito’s struggle, his
                           blood and martyrdom. As we celebrate the Kenyattas, Kagias
                                  and Onekos of this country, let us also celebrate
                      	                       Tito Adungosi as a national hero.
                      	                       We need an apology to the family.

                                        Reparation Framework


Introduction
1.	       The Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Act (TJR Act), under Section 6 (k) (i), requires
          the Truth Justice and Reconciliation Commission (the Commission) to:
              make recommendations with regard to the policy that should be followed or measures
              that should be taken with regard to the granting of reparation to victims or the taking
              of other measures aimed at rehabilitating and restoring the human and civil dignity of
              victims.

              Reparation is defined as “dignifying the victims by measure that will alleviate their
              suffering, compensate their social, moral and material losses, and restitute their rights.”1
              A primary responsibility of the proposed Committee for the Implementation of the
              Recommendations of the Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission (hereinafter ‘the
              Implementation Committee’) shall be to manage and administer reparations. Therefore,
              this Chapter outlines the Commission’s recommendations relating to reparation and
              how the Implementation Committee shall manage and administer such reparations.

Volume IV   Chapter THREE




            The Concept of Reparation
            2.	       The State of Kenya is responsible for reparations for the violations covered under
                      the mandate of the Commission, either because violations were perpetrated by
                      State agents or the State failed to protect its citizens. The right to reparation is
                      recognized2 under international law and Kenyan law. Victims can obtain reparation
                      either through state administrative programmes, or through recourse to the
                      courts. The burden of pursuing damages through the courts is high both for the
                      victims and the legal system. The reparation recommendations of the Commission
                      contained in this chapter aim to achieve the objective of reparation while avoiding
                      high burdens upon the victims, both individual and groups.

             Grounds for reparation
            3.	       The Commission recognizes that the key objective of reparations is to restore the
                      dignity of victims through acknowledging the wrongdoing, the harm suffered and
                      the state responsibility to promote, protect and fulfil human rights. In that way
                      reparations are a means to contribute to a rebalancing of society and a healing
                      process. These reparation recommendations are designed to be practical and
                      implementable. Other truth commissions’ recommendations have demonstrated
                      that this is most often a challenge. Unfortunately, recommending a proportionate
                      and tailored reparation measure for each individual victim would be impractical
                      and impossible to implement.

            4.	       In designing recommendations for reparation the Commission considered a
                      number of factors. These included, among others, the large number of victims in
                      Kenya and the extreme vulnerability of some groups of victims.

            5.	       It is against this background that priorities for reparations are set out and that the
                      Commission recognizes that realistically implementable reparations measures cannot
                      satisfy individual victims or respond adequately to individual suffering and harm.


            2	    The Constitution of Kenya (2010) at Article 2(5)-(6) stipulates that general rules of international law and any treaty or convention
                  ratified by Kenya shall form part of the law of Kenya. Several regional and international treaties have asserted the right to a remedy
                  and reparation for violations of serious human rights. International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights (1966) (Art 2(3), 9(5) and
                  14(6); International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD) (1965) (art 6), Convention on the
                  Right of the Child (1989) (Art 39) Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment or Punishment
                  (1984) (Art 14) and the Statute of the International Criminal Court (1998) (Art 75). Also the African Convention on Human and
                  Peoples’ Rights 1981 (Art 21(2), the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (Art
                  5(5), 13 and 41) and the American Convention on Human rights 1969 (Art. 25, 63(1) and 68). This right has also been affirmed by
                  regional human rights courts, United Nations bodies and other declarative instruments. E.g. Human Rights Committee, General
                  Comment No. 31 [80] nature of the General Legal Obligation Imposed on State parties to the Covenant 26/05/2004, (u.N. Doc.
                  No. CCPR/C/21/Rev.1/Add.13. atparas. 15-17; United Nations Committee against Torture, GC No.2, Implementation of Article 2 by
                  State Parties (U.N. Doc. CAT/C/GC/2/CRP.1/Rev.4 (2007),) at para 15.

Types of reparation
6.	The Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy and Reparation for
   Victims of Gross Violations of International Human Rights Law and Serious Violations
   of International Humanitarian Law3 have distinguished five forms of reparations.

          	    Restitution: restores the victim to the original situation before the violation
                occurred. It includes restoration of liberty, enjoyment of identity and
                citizenship

          	    Rehabilitation: includes medical and psychological care

          	    Compensation: provides money for damage suffered

          	    Satisfaction: includes official declarations restoring dignity and reputation,
                public apology, commemoration and tributes

          	    Guarantees of non-repetition: includes structural measures that will prevent
                re-occurrence of the violations.

7.	       The reparation recommendations below are a combination of measures that fall
          within these five forms.4 The reparation measures below can also be distinguished
          according to the beneficiary of the measure. Individual reparation measures will be
          available for certain individuals, while collective reparation measures will benefit
          a group of people or a community. Collective reparation measures aim to reach a
          larger group of people both from the perspective of increasing the effective use of
          resources and improving sustainability.

8.	       Another distinction is made between material reparation measures and non-material
          reparation measures. Material reparations measures imply a tangible benefit (e.g.
          monetary pension, provision of health services, socio-economic measure). Non-
          material reparations do not involve any provision of any monetary payments or
          free service provision, but instead address the harms suffered in ways that may
          not have any economic component. The latter are critical in restoring the dignity
          of victims and survivors, through the restoration of rights (expunging criminal
          records, granting citizenship), the provision of critical documents (identity cards) or
          honouring the memory of those who have suffered violations (through monuments,
          naming ceremonies or days of remembrance).

4	    Other recommendations of the TJRC can be considered as being part of guarantees of non-repetition and therefore are not
      detailed again in this chapter.

            Methodology
            9.	       The chapter is based on international standards concerning reparation. The
                      Commission considered the full extent of data it collected throughout its work with
                      victims, including from statements and memoranda, from hearings and from other
                      forms of interactions with the public. In addition, the Commission worked closely
                      with various state institutions, Kenyan and international civil society organisations
                      that have specific expertise on the topic of reparation.5

            Analysis of proposed forms of Reparation
            	         Moreover, the Commission’s Statement Taking Form included a section for recording
                      recommendations for reparation. The Form specifically asked statement givers to
                      indicate what form of reparation they preferred both at an individual and community
                      level. They were also asked to recommend what was best for the nation. Figures 1
                      and 2 below show the analysis of recommendations proposed by individuals and
                      communities respectively.

                                REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION                         101
Volume IV   Chapter THREE




            	       For recommendations for reparations to the nation, ‘legal and institutional reforms’
                    was the most popular at 23.2%. The second highest category was to ‘enhance the
                    peace and unity’ among the people of Kenya. Similar analysis was carried out
                    at regional levels when the TJRC reconciliation team went across the country to
                    conduct the reconciliation forums.

            Commission’s Recommendations relating to Reparation
            10.	    The Commission recommends that the National Assembly should append to the
                    proposed Committee for the Implementation of the Recommendations of the
                    Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission Act, a set of regulations relating
                    to reparation. The Reparation Regulations shall mirror the provisions of the
                    reparations policy framework outlined in this Chapter.

            Principles for the implementation of reparation measures
            11.	 The Commission underscores the importance of victims’ involvement in the
                 implementation of reparation measures and the need for victim empowerment
                 to this end. The responsible institutions have to be integrated as much as possible
                 in existing structures in order to avoid additional costs. The service logic has to be
                 applied by all structures involved; victims should not be faced with unnecessary
                 bureaucratic practices or burdens (e.g. avoidance of duplication of submission of
                 documents, etc.).

            12.	 It is through the combination of the various types of reparation measures
                 and the active involvement of victims in the implementation process that the
                 recommendations below aim to contribute to a process of reconciliation and
                 healing in Kenya.

            Eligibility for reparation measures
            13.	    The eligibility is determined by type of violations, the time of occurrence of
                    the violation and the type of beneficiaries. Both individuals and groups can be
                    beneficiaries of reparation measures.

            Violations
            14.	    Reparation measures are limited to gross violations of human rights as defined
                    inthe Commission’s mandate under the TJR Act. Gross violations of human rights
                    are those violations that were perpetrated by:
                     	     State agents as part of a policy or systematic course of action
                     	     Non-state actors acting with state complicity as part of a policy or systematic
                            course of action

          	    State or non-state actors as a result of the failure to protect in the context of
                large-scale human rights violations

15.	     Only violations occurring between 12 December 1963 and 28 February 2008 are
         considered eligible within this reparations framework. Gross violations of human
         rights are categorized as follows:

	       Category 1. Violations of the right to life

          	    Massacres

          	    Summary or arbitrary executions

          	    Political assassinations

          	    Disappearances or killings of political actors and human rights defenders in
                which the state was complicit.

	       Category 2. Violations of the right to personal integrity
          	    Torture

          	    Inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment of political detainees or
                human rights defenders

          	    Arbitrary arrests and illegal/prolonged detention of political detainees or
                human rights defenders

          	    Rape

          	    Sexual and gender-based violence other than rape

          	    Mutilation and grievous bodily harm6

	       Category 3. Forcible transfer of populations

          	    Conflict-induced displacement

          	    Development-induced displacement7 without appropriate consultation,
                compensation, and resettlement plans for communities

          	    Deaths or disability directly resulting from conditions of forced displacement

          	    Violations of ECOSOC rights within the context of forced displacement

Volume IV   Chapter THREE




            	      Category 4. Historical and contemporary land injustices

                     	     Illegal acquisition or occupation of land of communally held land

                     	     State seizure of private, community or Trust lands without sufficient public
                            purpose or for evident personal gain

                     	     Violations of the right to free, prior and informed consent in allocation of rights
                            to, or legal designation of, the ancestral lands of indigenous communities
                            specifically including hunter-gatherers, fisher peoples, and pastoralists.

            	     Category 5. Systematic marginalization

                     	     Direct discrimination through state policy (including identifiable patterns of
                            action or lack of action)

                     	     Facially neutral laws that have a discriminatory effect

                     	     Violations of minority rights to language, culture and religion

                     	     Violations of the right to nationality

                     	     Violation of indigenous peoples’ rights to identity and recognition

                     	     Violation of the group right to participation in decisions that directly affect the
                            minority or indigenous group in question

                     	     Violations of ECOSOC rights in the context of marginalization.

            Reparation measures and their prioritization
            16.	 This section details the beneficiaries and benefits available through the
                 reparations programme as recommended by the Commission. Under this
                 programme, both individuals and groups are eligible for reparations, but the
                 criteria for determining who ultimately benefits from reparations are designed
                 to ensure that the programme is manageable. Accordingly, the reparations
                 programme prioritizes extremely vulnerable individuals, groups who have
                 suffered injustice specifically including historical land injustices, and individuals
                 who have been victims of violations of the right to life as well as the right to
                 personal integrity.

            17.	    Human rights violations are by their nature interconnected. As described elsewhere
                    in this Chapter, individuals and communities are eligible for a series of reparation
                    measures. It is the intention of the Commission that this use of multiple measures

           Kenyans have experienced as well as the ripple effects that violations may have on
           a family or community throughout the generations.

Priority A: Most Vulnerable
Who is eligible under Priority A?
18.	       Victims who are defined as most vulnerable, using the criteria below are eligible for
           reparations in Priority A:

            	    Individual victims8 of gross human rights violations in Categories 1 & 2 above
                  who meet any of the following criteria will have their claims expedited:
                   	    Child victims (under 18 years of age at the time of filing)
                   	    Elderly victims (above 60 years of age at the time of filing)
                   	    Victims demonstrating urgent health concerns with a causal relationship
                         to the violations in categories 1 and 2
                   	    Single heads of household demonstrating significant economic hardship
                         with a causal relationship to the violations in categories 1 and 2

8	     In the case of an individual victim who has died as a result of the violation, her or his beneficiaries may apply for reparation
       and receive the reparation on his or her behalf, subject to regulations established by the TJRC recommendations or by the
       Implementation Mechanism .

Volume IV   Chapter THREE




                     	     Orphans (under 30 years at the time of filing) as a result of the violations in
                            Categories 1, 2, & 3 above also will have their claims expedited.

                     	     Individuals who died as a direct result of violations in Category 3 above.

            19.	    The Implementation Committee will conduct outreach and proactively register
                    victims in this category first. These claims will undergo an expedited adjudication
                    and will be eligible for the various forms of individual reparation specified under
                    Priority C below.

            20.	 Individuals who have already received monetary compensation should not
                 be available for additional monetary measures. Appendix 1 details monetary
                 compensation already awarded by courts to individual victims. However, the
                 Implementation Committee should inquire whether the amounts awarded have
                 actually been paid by the State and, if not, follow up to advocate compliance with
                 court orders.

            What reparations measures are available under Priority A?
            21.	    The number of victims of gross human rights violations that took place in Kenya
                    between 1963 and 2008 is vast. As expressed in several research and survey reports,
                    there is a clear demand among victims from across the spectrum that monetary
                    compensation would be the most effective type of reparation for them. However,
                    the class of eligible individuals who may receive financial compensation must
                    be narrowed in order to make any reparations programme financially feasible. In
                    addition, it has to be recognized that the necessarily limited amounts of monetary
                    compensation may not be sufficient to have a sustainable and meaningful impact
                    on the lives of the victims.

            22.	    Individuals who are determined to be eligible for reparations under Priority A will
                    receive the following reparation:

                     	     Compensation: Monetary compensation in the form of a standardized ten-year
                            annual payment (pension). If the eligible victim is deceased, compensation will
                            be paid to the immediate family of the victim pursuant to guidelines established
                            by the Implementation Committee.

                     	     Rehabilitation: Medical care and psychosocial service vouchers will be
                            provided to victims demonstrating need pursuant to guidelines established
                            by the Implementation Committee.

What are the evidentiary standards9 for Priority A?
23.	       Individuals registered for reparations should be considered for expedited processing
           if on the face of the claim it appears more likely than not that an individual is
           eligible for reparations under Priority A. Final eligibility of the individual for Priority
           A reparations should be determined based on a preponderance of the evidence
           demonstrating that the individual meets the criteria above. Evidence might
           include birth and death certificates, medical records, recommendations from the
           Implementation Committee’s partners (NCIC, KNCHR, CBOs, CSOs, NGOs), or other
           evidence as specified by the Reparations Regulations.




Priority B: Collective Reparations
24.	       This reparation framework adopts a deliberate policy of encouraging collective
           reparation so as to maximize the efficient use of available resources for reparations
           and because a substantial percentage of the grievances raised before the
           Commission relate to policies and practices that negatively impacted entire groups
           of people. As a result, collective reparation measures will receive the second highest
           priority for registration and processing. Collective reparation measures will be
           specifically handled by a Group Claims unit that will focus on helping communities
           document, register and administer a multidimensional for reparation package.

Who is eligible under Priority B?
25.	       Collective reparations will be awarded to groups of victims to remedy violations of
           individual and group rights. The beneficiary groups of victims may be bound by a
           common identity, experience or violation. Collective reparations will be available
           to groups of victims in the following instances:

            	    For victims who have suffered human rights violations as a group including
                   	    Systematic marginalization of minority and indigenous communities,
                         communities living in arid and semi-arid areas
                   	    Historical land injustices
                   	    Violations targeting and/or affecting populations of a specific area, such
                         as massacres, environmental degradation

            	    To address individual reparations through collective measures that could

       in the context of the violations listed in the categories above.

                            resources. Such measures may include enhancing victims’ ability to secure
                            micro-financing for business opportunities; provision of health services to
                            groups or regions; peer group support and counselling; and skills training.

                      	    To address structural inequalities such as identity and gender-based dimensions

                            citizenship rights, etc.)

                      	    To address needs for symbolic reparations, such as apologies, recognition of
                            groups, or memorials.

            What reparation measures are available under Priority B?
            26.	     This reparation framework identifies several collective reparation measures, both
                     material (such as socio-economic measures) and non-material (commemorative
                     measures). The collective reparations measures respond to various violations
                     and types of harm, both individual and collective. The interconnection between
                     the different violations and harms is fully recognised as well as the fact that the
                     interconnectedness may lead to aggravating effects. Though the set of violations
                     and the harm suffered are not considered as isolated occurrences, separate material
                     reparation measures and non-material measures are identified to deal with the
                     variety of violations and harms. It is recognised that none of these measures,
                     individually or jointly, will be able to undo the harm suffered by both individual
                     and communities. The measures aim to contribute to restore the balance in society,
                     provide material benefit and enhance public recognition of the suffering.

            Reparations for Historical Land Injustices
            27.	     The Commission prioritizes historical land injustices in reference to its mandate to
                     examine the causes and consequences of marginalization as well as the root causes
                     of ethnic conflict in Kenya.10 This is not to say that the Commission does not recognize
                     that individuals have also been victims of land injustices, but the Commission’s
                     mandate does not require it to deal directly with those violations. It was clear in the
                     Commission’s individual public hearings around the country that land injustices are
                     one of the major contributors to conflict and that land loss and development of lands
                     without any benefit to surrounding communities is one of the major contributors to
                     marginalization and ethnic tensions. The Commission recognizes that land injustices
                     are interconnected with many other human rights violations experienced by
            10	 TJR Act 2008, Functions of the Commission, Section 6(p) and (s)

       communities. As described elsewhere in this Chapter, communities are eligible for a
       series of reparation measures to address other human rights violations.
28.	   The Commission also recognizes that groups who have experienced documented
       and proven historical land injustices shall be eligible for reparations through the
       National Land Commission (as specifically mandated by Article 67(2)(e)) of the
       2010 Constitution and the National Land Commission Act No. 5 of 2012). The role
       of the Implementation Committee shall be limited to processing and forwarding to
       the National Land Commission all claims of historical land injustices received by the
       Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission. In this regard, the Implementation
       Committee shall review group claims and make recommendations to the National
       Land Commission as to the following potential reparations measures:

       	   Restitution of land (including conversion of public land to community land
            when feasible and appropriate)

       	   Formal recognition and registration of specific areas as ‘community land’ as
            defined under Article 63 of the Constitution (2010)

       	   Resettlement and/or access to alternative community lands

       	   Compensation

       	   Benefit-sharing schemes related to land on which development has taken
            place (e.g. Turkwell Gorge Dam, National Parks such as Hell’s Gate or Lake
            Bogoria, or the Lamu Port)

29.	   In processing and reviewing land claims for onward transmission to the National
       Land Commission, the Implementation Committee shall develop guidelines
       for:

       	   The standardization of historical injustice claims from communities.

       	   Investigating land claims in a participatory manner based on international best
            practices, and considering examples such as South Africa and New Zealand,
            and incorporating multiple forms of evidence, such as cultural memory, oral
            tradition, natural markers (i.e. trees, rivers, etc.), recognition by neighbouring
            groups, and other forms of evidence as determined in consultation with
            community groups.

       	   The level of evidence required, specifying at a minimum that groups must
            present clear and convincing evidence of their claims.

       	   Identifying overlapping land claims amongst communities and recommend

                            facilitated alternative dispute resolution (ADR) that takes account of customary
                            dispute resolution practices.

                      	    In recommending reparations measures, the Land Unit will:
                                     a.	    Consider the rights of bonafide third party purchasers in determining
                                            the appropriate reparations measure (e.g., compensation instead of
                                            restitution);

                                     b.	 Prioritize delineation and registration of community land through
                                         an approved Government of Kenya process;

                                     c.	 Whenever possible define community land in terms of ancestral
                                         boundaries, and in consideration of mapping exercises that have
                                         credibility amongst the community itself (whether those maps
                                         are from the colonial period, government surveys, or from recent
                                         community mapping exercises);

                                     d.	 Give enhanced weight to ritual and spiritual use of land by
                                         communities who are claiming restitution or ownership.

            30.	     These guidelines will also be forwarded to the National Land Commission as
                     recommendations for its work on historical land injustices.

            Socio-economic measures
            31.	     The Commission recommends that communities or groups of victims11 have
                     access to a process in which they can collectively decide upon the use of the
                     reparations funds for the community. A wide range of measures or combination
                     of measures can be envisaged; examples are a library for the community, a
                     micro-credit facility, a psychosocial service, or a child-care service for women
                     at work. In principle, the focus of the Commission’s recommendations for this
                     socio-economic collective reparation measure does not lie with the substance.
                     The Commission’s recommendations focus on the process to be followed by
                     the community to arrive at the determination of socio-economic reparation
                     measures. The final measures should however be guided by the principles of
                     non-discrimination, fairness and equality.

            32.	     Whether a community is eligible for a collective reparation fund should be
                     determined based on guidelines established by the Implementation Committee.
                     Those guidelines should minimally require that evidence of group harm and
                     need for a fund meets the more likely than not evidentiary standard. The

         amount of money available to the group or community will be determined by
         the number of victims in the community and the harm suffered. The amount
         available for collective reparations for a given group should also take into
         account any previous measures that have addressed part of the harm suffered,
         such as permanent resettlement of displaced persons. Immediate relief measures
         and/or humanitarian assistance, however, should not be taken into account in
         determining the amount available.

33.	     The groups will be supported by the Implementation Committee to propose a
         collective reparation measure or a set of measures. The Implementation Committee
         will, in consultation with victims, survivors, civil society groups and technical
         experts, develop clear guidelines and procedures for this engagement by and
         with the groups. These guidelines will aim to avoid elite capture and enable broad
         ownership of the proposed measures.

34.	     The Implementation Committee will develop guidelines to specify that socio-
         economic measures can be incorporated as a component of reparations only
         under the following minimum standards of participation:

          	    Affected communities have to be informed through a participatory and
                inclusive decision making process.

          	    The information process specifically targets inclusion of women and children.

          	    The proposed socio-economic measures have to include sustainability
                aspects.

          	    An independent, credible expert assessment of the impact of the proposed
                socio-economic measures has to be conducted. The assessment has to be
                shared with the communities in a way that they can understand, so as to
                enable them to be fully informed and give their opinions (local consultation
                rounds).

          	    The independent voices of most affected persons in the community (e.g.
                women, children or persons with disabilities, as the case may be) must be
                included in the consultation.12 A community decision to not adopt a specific
                socio-economic measure will be based on a qualified majority decision making.

                            The Implementation Committee will determine the principles for qualified
                            majority decision making thresholds for specific situations. For example, when
                            women or girls particularly suffered from the violations being addressed, a
                            qualified majority decision making means that at least a high percentage of
                            the people in favour of the measures must be female. Another example would
                            be the approval by a minimum percentage of persons with disabilities in cases
                            where the measure responds to an event that has caused a lot of physical
                            impairment. Modern technology or community practices can be used when
                            expressing support or non-support (e.g. SMS voting systems or community
                            information boards).

                      	    The participatory processes should recognise and incorporate customary
                            structures of decision making, to the extent they respect the minimum
                            standards here above.

                      	    The Implementation Committee has to overview the participation process or
                            mandate a local actor to do so.

            35.	     The Implementation Committee will formalize the principles of participation into a
                     procedure of participation.

            Government policy measures
            36.	     The government must also prioritise socio-economic development as a significant
                     component of reparations for groups, under Priority B above, especially as a means
                     of correcting historic marginalisation of communities. The use of development as
                     a component of reparation is often problematic as States have a clear obligation to
                     ensure the right to development, which is separate from any obligation to provide
                     reparations. Whereas reparations and development are often conceptualised and
                     approached independently, for victims the demand for both arises simultaneously.13
                     Unlike the State’s obligations to provide basic services to all its citizens, this
                     particular reparation programme has to be linked with the State’s previous neglect
                     and/or oppression of marginalised areas or groups and its attempt to correct this
                     injustice.

            37.	     The issue of exclusion from national social, cultural and political processes is central
                     to marginalization. Reparative measures must include specific and deliberate
                     efforts by the government to prioritise development of marginalisedregions and
                     communities in order to build trust and integrate them into the national fabric.

          What will distinguish these reparative measures from other development projects
          is the moral and political content under which they are undertaken. They must not
          be implemented in isolation but will be accompanied by a symbolic dimension. For
          instance, the government needs to acknowledge that it is prioritising development
          of marginalised areas such as North Eastern Kenya because of previous neglect.
          The victims on the other hand need to feel entitled to the development because
          their rights have been violated.

38.	      The Commission therefore specifically recommends that:

          	   Within one year of the submission of the Commission’s Final Report to
               the President of Kenya, the government enact and implement a policy
               that deliberately targets the socio-economic development of historically
               marginalised areas in Kenya.

          	   This policy must include strategic development plans and budgetary
               allocations aimed at the economic and social development of marginalised
               communities.

          	   The policy recognizes that these reparative actions are over and above
               the provisions of Article 204 of the Constitution (2010) in utilisation of the
               Equalisation Fund.

          	   The Government consider actions such as building an efficient road networks
               linking marginalized areas with the rest of Kenya, building boreholes and
               water-catchment systems, building hospitals within reach of all communities
               adequately stocked and well-staffed, schools with adequate facilities, courts of
               law, and ensure that all government services and public facilities are available
               to them.

          	   In the five years subsequent to the enactment of the policy, preference be
               given to marginalised areas in the sharing of national revenues as envisaged
               under Article 202 of the Constitution (2010) to ensure that the development
               projects are realised and the policy is implemented.

39.	      The government can utilise development of marginalised areas as a tool to create
          sustainable, culturally relevant change. The development policies and implementation
          cannot, and should not, replace long-term development strategies. They should be
          designed to be the initial transformative face of the government in order to create trust
          and set the stage for more positive long-term interaction between the government
          and the marginalised communities.14

            Non-material reparation measures
            40.	 Collective reparations will include non-material measures which, while
                 insufficient to fully address the harm suffered by victims, will provide recognition
                 of victims’ experiences, restore their dignity and reputation, and demonstrate the
                 State’s acknowledgement of responsibility for violations and its resolve to ensure
                 non-recurrence. Non-material measures have the potential to rebuild civic trust
                 in the government, particularly among communities that have hitherto suffered
                 systematic violations. These measures also provide an opportunity for closure for
                 victims. The Implementation Committee shall engage with groups to develop
                 proposals, and then with State institutions and other appropriate entities to
                 ensure implementation of the above non-material measures.

            41.	    Some of the non-material reparative measures that should be provided to victims
                    include:

                            i)	 Restitution of civil rights including expunging criminal records of
                                victims who were wrongly convicted of crimes for political reasons;

                            ii)	   provision of citizenship documents to those who have been denied this
                                   right due to discriminatory policies etc.

                            iii)	 Revocation of laws and policies that perpetuate discrimination on the
                                  basis of gender and ethnic or religious identity

                            iv)	 Removal of legal and other obstacles to the realization of accountability
                                 for violations, e.g. the Indemnity Act.

                            v)	 Official recognition of marginalized communities, e.g. in official census
                                processes, and in registration of community groups.

                            vi)	 Clarification of historical facts to facilitate a common public understanding
                                 of Kenya’s past e.g. in education curricula; and expositions in museums.

                            vii)	 Identification of disappeared individuals, including through exhumation
                                  and reburial.

                            viii)	 Official State acknowledgement of responsibility and formal apologies
                                   to victims

                            ix)	 Establishment of memorials and tributes to commemorate victims
                                 including observance of special days of remembrance, naming of

                                                                                                                      Vol u m e IV       Chapter THREE




42.	      Points viii and ix are discussed in more detail below.
Public Apologies and Memorialization
43.	      Of the five types of reparations internationally recognized, satisfaction refers to a series
          of measures including public apologies, commemorations and memorialization15.
          This form of reparation is considered “symbolic” in that it entails recognition of
          wrongdoing, acceptance of historical injustices and recognition of the suffering and
          experiences of victims rather than material compensations. Symbolic reparations are
          aimed at fostering recognition, at restoring the dignity of victims and at making the
          suffering and experiences of victims part of the public domain, thus transferring the
          burden of keeping the memory alive from victims and their families to society as a
          whole.16

44.	      The right to satisfaction for victims of gross human rights violations is internationally
          recognized by UN General Assembly Resolution 60/140 of 200517 on the right to
          remedy and reparation, which states under Article 22 that “satisfaction should
          include any or all of the following: public apology, including acknowledgement of
          the facts and acceptance of responsibility; and commemorations and tributes to
          the victims.

45.	      Section 5 (h) (i) of the TJR Act 2008 defines one of the objectives of the Commission
          as to promote healing and reconciliation by, among other things, “providing
          repentant perpetrators or participants in gross human rights violations with a
          forum to confess their actions as a way of bringing reconciliation.” In addition, the
          Commission is mandated to looking specifically at the perspectives of victims.18

The concept of public apologies
46.	      Public apologies are acknowledgement of wrongdoing by governments and other
          political entities. States have a general duty to acknowledge past human rights
          abuses.19 This duty is rooted in thenotion of the State’s responsibility to provide
          security for its citizens and ensure law and order20. The Oxford Dictionary defines
          public apology as aregretful acknowledgment of an offense or failure or a formal,
          public statement of regret, such as one issued by a government.21

            47.	      The principle of State continuity in Public International Law recognizes that “a
                      State’s identity as a legal person persists notwithstanding unconstitutional or even
                      violent changes in its government.”22 Accordingly, the State is legally responsible
                      for actions and omissions of previous regimes and governments.

            48.	      To be reconciliatory, a public apology needs to be sincere, and to include at least
                      the following elements:

                      	    Acceptance of blame by the State for past abuses23: the State must recognize
                            that it failed in its fundamental duties;

                      	    Specificity of the apology: it must be made cleared what violations and abuses
                            the apology is meant to cover; it is not sufficient to apologize in general;

                      	    Recognition of victims: the apology must recognize the suffering of victims
                            and aim at restoring their dignity;

                      	    Recognition of the immoral character of the violations and abuses committed24;

                      	    Recognition of the need for reform: the apology must include an aspect of
                            redress and a guaranty of non-repetition25;

                      	    The apology needs to be public in that it needs to be given sufficient publicity
                            in the media or otherwise to reach victims.

            The concept of memorialization
            49.	      Complementary to the State’s duty to apologize for past violations is the State’s
                      responsibility to preserve the memory of those violations26. Memorialization refers
                      to the process of perpetuating the memory of a person, group of persons, incident,
                      event or era.27Memorialization and commemoration can assist divided societies to
                      re-write the narratives of the past, recognize victims of human rights violations and
                      begin the process of healing and reconciliation.

            50.	      Possible measures include the renaming of public spaces and buildings; the
                      creation of memorials, statues and museums; the dedication of places of detention
                      and torture to sites of memory; calls for artistic contributions and art exhibits; and
                      the establishment of national days for remembrance.

116         REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION
                                                                                                                     Vol u m e IV       Chapter THREE




51.	     In order to contribute to reconciliation efforts, victim groups and communities
         need to be involved in the design, the choice of location and the use of memorials.
         Making the wrong choices can lead to re-traumatization of victims and feelings of
         exclusion and marginalization if a group of victims or a specific community is left out.
         Equally, politicization of the process of memorialization and commemoration can be
         offensive and insulting to victims, for example when repressive governments build
         statues to the glory of a dictator or establish national days to commemorate the use
         of repressive authority.28

52.	     Memorials can foster reconciliation in the following ways:

          	    Memorial sites can serve as spaces to foster public dialogue and discussions
                on past abuses and a common vision for the future;

          	    Memorialization processes can assist in correcting distorted versions of
                the past and enabling societies to build consensus on a common historical
                narrative;

          	    Memorialscan help keep social and political issues on the agenda and can be
                used for advocacy and pedagogical purposes;

          	    Memorialization can serve as a reminder of the futility of violence and a pledge
                for the non-repetition of the past.

Public Apologies and Memorialization in other Truth Commissions
53.	     To determine its approach to symbolic reparations and design recommendations,
         the Commission considered experiences of other truth commissions around the
         world and their work on public apologies and memorialization.

54.	     The Truth and Reconciliation Commission for Sierra Leone (TRC SL) used the
         concept of “symbolic reparations” to recommend, among other things, the
         creation of memorials as a means to restore the dignity of victims and facilitate
         healing and reconciliation, and recommended that victims and their communities
         be consulted in the creation of the memorials.29 Further, the TRC SL considered
         that symbolic reparations can address the needs of victims for remembrance.
         In this line, the TRC SL recommended that the government recognize the
         suffering of victims and apologize publicly for the “actions and inactions of all

    his rule and named the day after himself.

                     governments” since independence30. Finally, the TRC SL recommended the use
                     of commemoration ceremonies and dates, including the creation of a national
                     reconciliation day.31 The TRC SL issued a call for public contributions in the form
                     of works of art to express people’s experiences of the conflict and aspirations
                     for the future; this initiative was called the National Vision for Sierra Leone and
                     contributions received32 were integrated in an exhibit that was toured around
                     the country and abroad.

            55.	     The South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission (SA TRC), in its final report,
                     defined symbolic reparations as “measures aimed at restoring the dignity of
                     victims and survivors of gross human rights violations. These include measures to
                     facilitate the communal process of commemorating the pain and celebrating the
                     victories of the past.”33 The SA TRC recommended interventions at the individual,
                     community and national levels. The SA TRC also considered the role of works of art
                     in memorialization, for example plays that contribute to remembrance and public
                     dialogue on past violations.

            56.	     The National Commission for Truth and Reconciliation in Chile also recommended
                     symbolic reparations in the form of creation of memorials and artistic projects
                     to recognize the memory of victims and promote peaceful coexistence. The
                     Commission also recommended that the government fully use the National Human
                     Rights Day to promote respect for human rights.34

            57.	     The Timor-Leste Commission for Reception, Truth and Reconciliation (CAVR) as,
                     among other initiatives, created a public interactive exhibition on its final report,
                     located in the old Dili prison.35 It also recommended that victims and communities
                     be consulted in the design of memorials, which it considers “symbolic measures
                     to honour victims of past atrocities, strengthen the social commitment to oppose
                     repetition of such acts, are educative and promote reconciliation.”36

            On-going memorialization initiatives in Kenya
            58.	     Current initiatives at memorialization and commemoration in Kenya include:

Recommendations on public apologies and memorialisation
59.	 The Commission in section 6(k)(i) of the TRC Act was mandated to ‘make
     recommendations with regard to the policy that should be followed or measures
     that should be taken with regard to the granting of reparation to victims or the
     taking of other measures aimed at rehabilitating and restoring the human and
     civil dignity of victims’. In this regard, and in the spirit of fostering reconciliation
     and recognizing the suffering of victims, the Commission makes the following
     recommendations:

          a)	 The Commission recommends that the Government of Kenya, through
              the President, formally acknowledge the occurrence of and apologize to
              Kenyans for gross violations of human rights committed in Kenya between
              12 December 1963 and 28 February 2008.

          b)	 The Commission recommends that State security agencies, and in
              particular the National Police Service, the National Defence Forces and the
              National Intelligence Service, apologize for gross violations of human rights
              committed by their predecessor agencies between 12 December 1963 and
              28 February 2008, especially acts of extra-judicial killings, arbitrary and
              prolonged detention, torture and sexual violence.

          c)	 The Commission recommends that the Judiciary apologize to the people
              of Kenya for failing to address impunity effectively and perform its role of
              deterrence to prevent the perpetration of gross human rights violations,
              during the period between 12 December 1963 and 28 February 2008.

          d)	 The Commission recommends that the air strip in Wagalla, Wajir, be made a

                                 national monument to commemorate the victims of the Wagalla massacre.
                                 The Commission recommends that sites of other massacres also be
                                 considered for memorialization, in close consultation with the communities
                                 affected.

                          e)	 The Commission recommends that the Nyayo House basement (which
                              served as torture chambers) be converted into a museum and a monument
                              in commemoration of the victims of torture by state security agencies.

                          f )	 The Commission recommends that the Implementation Committee
                               create a sub-committee to call for and consider community proposals
                               for memorialization and for funding for community initiatives aimed at
                               commemoration of past violations, specific events and victims of gross
                               human rights violations.

                          g)	 The Commission recommends the creation of a National Human Rights
                              Day on 10 December, to coincide with the international Human Rights Day,
                              which will be used to promote respect for human rights in Kenya.




            Priority C: Individual Reparations – Non Expedited
            Who is eligible under Priority C?
            60.	      Priority C applies to individual victims who have experienced violations in Category
                      1 or 2. Individuals who have the opportunity to access material reparations under
                      Priority A or B cannot access reparations under this Priority. Reparations in this
                      Priority are functionally a symbolic payment designed only to acknowledge the
                      violation and state responsibility. The harm that victims experienced can never be
                      fully repaired, and this policy does not attempt to do so.

            What reparations are available under Priority C?
            61.	      Individuals are eligible for monetary compensation in the form of a standardized
                      five-year pension.37 If the victim is deceased, compensation will be paid to the
                      immediate family of the victim.38 The amount of the pension per deceased victim is
            37	 The pension for individual compensation is proposed because of the problematic implementation of lump-sum payments in multiple
                contexts, including in Kenya, such as the compensation granted for Maasai land claims. Moreover, the pension scheme is time-
                bound so as to allow the government of Kenya to plan for a defined cost, as opposed to an indefinite term based on the lifetime of
                the beneficiaries.
            38	 The Implementation Mechanism will be required to determine appropriate regulations to equitably distribute reparations to
                deceased victims’ families. See the Chilean pension scheme for an example of a potential formula which allocated 40% to a
                surviving spouse, 30% to the mother of the deceased, and 15% for each child of the deceased, even if this amounted to more than
                100%. Pablo de Greiff, ed., The Handbook of Reparations (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006), p. 754.

          standard and does not vary regardless of the number of family members eligible
          as indirect victims. Individuals are eligible for non-material reparation such as
          restitution of rights, dignity and recognition. Restitution of rights, dignity, and
          recognition, including for example:
                    i.	    Criminal records of those who were wrongly convicted of crimes for
                           political reasons or whose confessions were extracted as a result of
                           torture should be expunged.
                    ii.	   Individuals who were denied citizenship or identity documents as a result
                           of discriminatory policies should be granted appropriate documentation.

What are the evidentiary standards39 for Priority C?
52.	      Certain classes of individuals may be determined to be eligible for reparations
          based on the victim mapping exercise. In the event that evidentiary assumptions
          cannot be made based on mapping, individual victims should demonstrate their
          claim based on a preponderance of the evidence standard.


Victim Participation
63.	      Participation of victims in the process of design, implementation, and monitoring
          of the reparations programme is a fundamental principle. The Implementation
          Committee will be required to develop policies on engagement with victims and
          their representatives through each stage of the reparations process. The policies
          should consider:

          	    How victims currently are mobilized/organized

          	    Which victims may be left out of existing structures

          	    How women and girl victims can most effectively participate in reparations
                processes

          	    How marginalized victims can be facilitated to participate in reparations
                processes

          	    How participation in reparations programs can enhance victim capacity building
                to advocate for their own interests and contribute to empathy amongst victims

64.	      The Implementation Committee will develop operational guidelines and principles

                    for victim participation to be applied when collective reparation measures are
                    designed and implemented.
            65.	    The Implementation Committee will review all operational plans with the view to
                    integrating the voices of victims in the process. The Implementation Committee
                    will be specifically tasked with procuring regular and independent evaluations of
                    the Implementation Committee interaction with victims throughout its mandate.
                    Reports on victim participation and victim satisfaction with the Implementation
                    Mechanism and other reparations service providers will be submitted to the
                    Implementation Committee every six months, and will include a scientific sampling
                    of victim opinion on these issues.


            Financing Reparations
            66.	    The Reparation Fund shall be appropriated annually from the Consolidated Fund.
                    Because many aspects of the reparations programme should be implemented by
                    existing government entities, this provides the opportunity for donor support to
                    those institutions to enhance their capacity to effectively provide the required
                    services under the reparations mandate.

            67.	    The Commission specifically recommends that during the life of the Implementation
                    Committee, assets recovered through corruption proceedings of the Ethics
                    and Anti-Corruption Commission and the Kenyan Courts are used to fund the
                    reparations process.

                                                                                      Vol u m e IV   Chapter THREE




Annex 1:
Victims’ Reparations Fund Guidelines

1.	   The TJRC’s understanding of reparations is in line with the definition provided in section
      2 of the TJR Act and the UN's Basic Principles on the Right to a Remedy and Reparation.
      Section 2 defines reparations as follows
           Reparation means dignifying the victims by measure that will alleviate their suffering,
           compensate their social, moral and material losses, and restitute their rights.
2.	 The UN's Basic Principles on the Right to a Remedy and Reparation, which provides a
    comprehensive understanding of reparations, lists five basic categories of reparations:
    restitution or restitutio in integrum: compensation; rehabilitation; satisfaction and;
    guarantees of non-repetition.
3.	 While the scope of reparations is broad, the resources of the Victims’ Reparations Fund
    shall be applied for the following purposes:
         a.	   Compensation of victims, both individually and communally
         b.	   Rehabilitation of victims by providing medical and psychosocial assistance
         c.	Memorialization
         d.	   Exhumation, identification and reburial of victims


4.	 The Commission appreciates that the ongoing constitutional and institutional reforms
    accommodate and address various aspects of reparations, including lustration
    (administrative sanctions), and guarantees of non-repetition (by reforming institutions
    implicated in gross violations such as the security forces and prisons). In addition, the
    Constitution provides for various mechanisms and facilities that are reparative in nature.
    For instance, in addition to extensive affirmative action measures that should guarantee
    inclusion of previously marginalized groups in political life, the equalization fund to be
    used to supplement provision of social services for previously marginalized regions and
    counties is partly reparative. Equally, as outlined in the Report’s chapter on economic
    marginalization, the devolution framework, through which a portion of national
    revenues will flow to counties, constitutes a structural response to economic injustice
    and marginalization. A number of other devolved funds such as the Constituency
    Development Fund (CDF) have a similar function.
5.	 For the reasons advanced in the preceding paragraph, the Reparations Fund proposed
    will, in as far as compensation is concerned, be applied in favour of individual victims and
    establish flagship projects in favour of communities identified through set criteria.
6.	 The Commission recommends that in line with the Annexed policy on reparations, the
    implementation of the reparations program must prioritize urgent interim measures that
    provide immediate assistance, services and facilities to the most vulnerable victims.
7.	 Aware that a recent reparations program by government favored or focused on a




                               REPORT OF THE TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION                     123
Volume IV   Chapter THREE




                  specific category of victims (IDPs from PEV), the Commission recommends that in line
                  with its report (that relates to a wide range of gross violations of human rights), that the
                  implementation of reparations program must relate to and cover all categories of victims.
            8.	 The Commission recommends that the Victims’ Reparations Fund shall operate as a ‘no
                liability model’, in terms of which eligibility for an award is based on being a victim who
                meets set criteria (based on loss or injury suffered) even in the absence of an identified
                perpetrator. Having considered various approaches adopted by other reparations
                programs, the Commission believes that this is the best approach as it guarantees access
                to justice for the greatest number of deserving victims who would face difficulties should
                the identification of perpetrators be a precondition for eligibility. Funds obtained from
                identified perpetrators through avenues provided in the law can benefit specific victims
                or be added to the Fund to benefit a larger group in appropriate cases.
            9.	 The Commission proposes the adoption of the definition of ‘victim’ used in its report,
                which is consistent with international human rights instruments, in particular, the Basic
                Principles on the Right to a Remedy and Reparation and Rule 85 of the International
                Criminal Court’s Rules of Procedure and Evidence. In line with these instruments, a victim
                is a natural person who has suffered harm as a result of the commission of any gross
                violation of human rights. A victim includes someone directly affected by the violation,
                as well as relatives of that direct victim.
            10.	 The Commission notes that because the nature and design of the body that implements
                 reparations is crucial to the success of a reparations program, the Reparations Fund must
                 conform to at least the following imperatives:

                      a.	 Gender sensitivity and perspectives in the design, structure, operations and
                          evaluation.
                      b.	   Implementation at the County and National levels;
                      c.	   Involvement of actors across various government ministries and departments
                            given that reparations needs are dispersed across almost all ministries
                            (infrastructure, housing, lands, education health and finance etc);
                      d.	 Consultation of victims at all stages of the design and implementation of the
                          reparations program
            11.	 The Commission recommends that the government commit an initial KES 500m to the
                 Reparations Fund.
